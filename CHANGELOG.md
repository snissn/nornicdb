## [v1.1.3] - 2026-05-29

Maintenance release: **llama.cpp upgraded to b9410** with configurable per-model context features, plus several storage and Bolt correctness fixes discovered through expanded test coverage. No on-disk format changes; existing databases upgrade transparently.

### Added

- **Per-model llama.cpp context feature passthrough.** Each model domain (embedding, rerank, Heimdall) now accepts env-driven llama.cpp context parameters so operators can tune models that require non-default settings (e.g. MTP-trained models, CLS pooling, rank pooling):
  - Embedding: `NORNICDB_EMBEDDING_CTX_TYPE`, `NORNICDB_EMBEDDING_POOLING_TYPE`, `NORNICDB_EMBEDDING_ATTENTION_TYPE`, `NORNICDB_EMBEDDING_FLASH_ATTN`
  - Rerank: `NORNICDB_RERANK_CTX_TYPE`, `NORNICDB_RERANK_POOLING_TYPE`, `NORNICDB_RERANK_ATTENTION_TYPE`, `NORNICDB_RERANK_FLASH_ATTN`
  - Heimdall: `NORNICDB_HEIMDALL_CTX_TYPE`, `NORNICDB_HEIMDALL_POOLING_TYPE`, `NORNICDB_HEIMDALL_ATTENTION_TYPE`, `NORNICDB_HEIMDALL_FLASH_ATTN`

### Changed

- **llama.cpp upgraded from b9106 → b9410.** Build scripts and Dockerfiles now disable the new `app/` and `tools/` targets (`-DLLAMA_BUILD_TOOLS=OFF`, `--target llama --target ggml`) to avoid link errors against `llama-server-impl`. Context creation explicitly sets `ctx_type = LLAMA_CONTEXT_TYPE_DEFAULT` to prevent struct-layout mismatches from accidentally enabling MTP on non-MTP models.

### Fixed

- **Cypher:** `$dotted.param` parsing no longer fails; the simple-where cache is correctly skipped for parameterized values.
- **Storage:** Node label index is rebuilt from bodies on engine open (#183), fixing incorrect `db.labels()` results after unclean shutdown.
- **Storage:** Label-count metadata is now namespaced per-database, preserving correctness across async write paths and startup re-indexing.
- **Bolt:** Running queries are cancelled on client disconnect and `RESET`, preventing goroutine/resource leaks.

### Tests

- Expanded unit test coverage across cypher, bolt, storage, search, server, heimdall, fabric, kms, multidb, otel, and grpc packages.

## [v1.1.2] - 2026-05-26

Headline release: **Bolt over WebSocket** lands end-to-end so browser-based Neo4j drivers connect to NornicDB without a proxy, and **per-database BM25 + vector index master switches** ship as a first-class memory and warmup-cost lever for multi-tenant deployments. Three independently reported Cypher correctness regressions (mcp-neo4j-memory) are fixed with deeply-asserted parity against Neo4j 5.x DDL and Lucene wildcard semantics. A profile-led overhaul of the shortestPath traversal stack drops latency ~400× on the demo workload. No on-disk format changes; existing `v1.1.x` databases upgrade transparently.

### Added

- **Bolt over WebSocket — browser drivers connect natively.** The Bolt port (`:7687` by default) now multiplexes four wire-level transports off one listener, sniffing the first 5 bytes of every accepted connection: `bolt://` (raw TCP, today's path), `bolt+s://` (TLS), `ws://` (WebSocket over plain TCP), `wss://` (TLS + WebSocket). The architecture mirrors Neo4j's `TransportSelectionHandler`: WebSocket frames carry the same Bolt magic + version negotiation + PackStream + chunked framing that raw TCP does, so existing drivers (Go, Java, Python, JavaScript browser, .NET) speak the same protocol on either transport. Operator-configurable knobs cover origin allowlist (default `*`), max message size (default 65 536 bytes, matching Neo4j's `MAX_WEBSOCKET_FRAME_SIZE`), ping/pong cadence (default 30 s ping / 60 s pong), pre-HELLO auth deadline, transport-sniff timeout, mTLS `ClientAuthMode` (`none`/`request`/`request_verify`/`require_verify`), `RequireTLS` (rejects every plaintext upgrade with the canonical Neo4j error), `WebSocketEnabled=false` (returns HTTP 426 on real WS upgrades while still serving the discovery probe to health checks), and operator-driven cert rotation via 5-second `tls.Config.GetCertificate` re-read with atomic-rename semantics. A plain `GET /` on the Bolt port returns a Neo4j-parity discovery response (200 OK + 5 required headers; empty body for Community parity, JSON describing the OAuth provider when `NORNICDB_AUTH_PROVIDER=oauth`). Phase-3 throughput, allocation, and round-trip benchmarks ship for all four transports; ws stays within a 5 % budget vs raw tcp and ws_tls within 0.3 % of tcp_tls.

  Auth: HELLO `scheme=bearer`/`basic` always wins. As a deliberate exception for first-party browser clients the WS upgrade reads the `nornicdb_token` cookie and `Authorization: Bearer …` header; either is honored as an "implicit bearer" when HELLO is `scheme=none`. Cookie wins on conflict; raw TCP has no HTTP layer so the implicit path is unreachable there.

  Configuration: 13 new `NORNICDB_BOLT_*` env vars (TLS cert/key/require/CA/auth-mode, WS enabled/origins/max-message/write-buffer/ping/pong, sniff/auth timeouts) plumbed through env → CLI → YAML. Documented in `docs/operations/configuration.md` (Bolt over WebSocket + TLS section), `docs/operations/environment-variables.md`, `docs/user-guides/connecting-bolt.md` (Neo4j-compatible scheme table for every official driver), and `pkg/bolt/README.md`. Metric schema migrated: `bolt_connections_active` becomes a `GaugeVec`, `bolt_connections_total` gains a closed-enum `transport` label (cardinality 3 → 12), plus new `bolt_connections_rejected_total{reason}` and `bolt_websocket_oversized_total` counters. `dashboards`/Grafana dashboards continue to work; queries that filtered only on `result` should be updated to also project `transport`.

- **NornicDB browser UI uses Bolt over WebSocket end-to-end.** The embedded admin UI swapped its HTTP `/tx/commit` Cypher transport for the official `neo4j-driver` browser build over `ws://` / `wss://`, configured automatically from the discovery response. Same-origin `nornicdb_token` cookie carries auth into every query so the UI's executeCypher path is one network round trip with no token-juggling JavaScript. Vite plugins (`neo4jBrowserChannelPlugin`, `nodeShimPlugin`) wire the driver's browser channel correctly under Vite 8 / Rolldown. The HTTP server's UI handler now serves SPA routes with trailing slashes (`/databases/`) directly instead of returning HTTP 400 — refreshing on any nested route works.

- **Per-database search index master switches and warming triggers.** Four new orthogonal keys configure BM25 fulltext and vector ANN behavior independently per database:
  - `NORNICDB_SEARCH_BM25_ENABLED` (boolean, default `true`) — master switch for BM25 fulltext search.
  - `NORNICDB_SEARCH_BM25_WARMING` (enum: `startup`|`lazy`, default `startup`) — eager build at boot or deferred until first query.
  - `NORNICDB_SEARCH_VECTOR_ENABLED` (boolean, default `true`) — master switch for every vector search strategy (HNSW, IVF-HNSW, brute-force, GPU, Metal, Qdrant pass-through). When false, node embeddings are NOT iterated into the in-memory ANN substrate — the strongest available memory-pressure lever.
  - `NORNICDB_SEARCH_VECTOR_WARMING` (enum: `startup`|`lazy`, default `startup`).

  Defaults reproduce today's behavior; existing deployments need no change. Configurable via env, CLI flags (`--search-bm25-enabled`, etc.), `nornicdb.yaml` global `memory:` block, and yaml `databases:` map for per-database overrides. Runtime overrides via `PUT /admin/databases/{name}/config` always win over global defaults in **both directions** (per-DB `true` enables a globally-disabled index; per-DB `false` disables a globally-enabled one). Lazy-warming is a synchronous-wait contract: the first inbound search request from any entry point (HTTP, Bolt, GraphQL, gRPC, Cypher procedures) blocks inside `Service.EnsureWarm` until the build completes; concurrent first-readers all wait on the same `sync.Once`. The build runs in the DB's long-lived context so a request that times out during the wait does NOT abort the build.

  Migration: zero. Documented in [`docs/operations/configuration.md#per-database-search-index-control`](docs/operations/configuration.md), [`docs/operations/low-memory-mode.md`](docs/operations/low-memory-mode.md), [`docs/user-guides/hybrid-search.md`](docs/user-guides/hybrid-search.md), and the openapi spec. See `docs/plans/per-database-search-index-flags-plan.md` for design context.

- **Lucene wildcard parity for fulltext indexes.** `db.index.fulltext.queryNodes` and `db.index.fulltext.queryRelationships` accept all three Lucene wildcard shapes:
  - `*` — `MatchAllDocsQuery`; every document in the index.
  - `*:*` — Solr-style equivalent of `*`.
  - `<prop>:*` — field-presence query; every doc that has a non-empty value for the named property.

  Each shape honors the index's declared scope (label list for nodes, relationship-type list for edges) and declared property allowlist. An undeclared field returns empty (matching Neo4j-Lucene posting-list semantics). The previous behavior — wildcard queries returning 0 rows or, conversely, returning every node regardless of label scope — is fixed.

- **Relationship-scoped fulltext indexes.** `CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX <name> [IF NOT EXISTS] FOR ()-[r:Type]-() ON EACH [r.prop1, r.prop2]` (Neo4j 5.x DDL form) is now supported. `db.index.fulltext.queryRelationships('idx', '...')` scans only relationships whose type matches the index's declared scope, instead of every edge in the graph. Persistence is forwards/backwards compatible: the new `RelationshipTypes` schema field uses `omitempty`, so old binaries reading new files see no extra key, and new binaries reading old files see an empty slice (which falls back to the legacy unscoped behavior). No on-disk schema-version bump.

- **`/cyber` demo route — cyber-physical graph visualization.** Interactive 3D visualization seeded with sectors, hyperlanes, and traversable paths against a `cyber_demo` database, exercising the same hot-path Cypher cookbook as `/demo` (UnwindSimpleMergeBatch + UnwindMultiMatchCreateBatch). Pinned for benchmark and operator-demo scenarios.

### Changed

- **`shortestPath` traversal latency cut ~400× on the demo workload (M3 Max, ~1 000 nodes / ~5 000 edges).** Profile-led cleanup spanning storage, Cypher, and UI:
  - `AsyncEngine` adds a per-node inverted index over `edgeCache` so `GetOutgoingEdges` / `GetIncomingEdges` run in O(degree) instead of O(total cached edges). The BFS-frontier full-cache scan that scaled with total seeded edges is gone.
  - `BadgerEngine` adds an edge-body cache and per-node adjacency-ID cache. BFS-style reads on a stable graph skip Badger entirely after the first visit. Cache returns shared pointers (read-only contract) so repeated hits don't pay copyEdge.
  - New `AdjacentEdgesEngine` capability fetches both directions in a single view txn; plumbed through `AsyncEngine`, `NamespacedEngine`, and `WALEngine`.
  - `NamespacedEngine.toUserEdge` / `toUserNode` drop a deep-copy branch; all `Get*Edges` callers treat results read-only and clone via `CopyNode`/`CopyEdge` before mutating.
  - Cypher `shortestPath` BFS now uses parent-pointer reconstruction instead of per-neighbor `GetNode` during traversal; one `BatchGetNodes` at the end materializes the path. Calls `GetAdjacentEdges` when the storage chain supports it.
  - Cypher `findNodeByPattern` consults `SchemaManager.PropertyIndexLookup` before falling back to a label scan (mirrors `merge.go`).

  Cumulative result on the in-process bench: warm bench 14.5 ms / 156K allocs → 36 µs / 229 allocs; latency mean ~12 ms → 874 µs; latency p99 ~26 ms → 2.2 ms.

- **Strict-typed property round-trip preserved end-to-end.** A long-standing widening regression — caller writes `[]float64` / `[]string` / `[]int64`, storage hands back `[]interface{}` on every read — is fixed. The msgpack property codec inspects array headers and decodes homogeneous arrays into their declared concrete slice types; mixed arrays still fall back to `[]interface{}`. Maps recurse the same way. The Cypher path's `substituteParams` short-circuits typed list parameters (`$rows = []float64`) so they stay as `$name` references through the parser instead of being stringified into Cypher list literals (which forced re-decode as `[]interface{}`). Threaded `ctx` through ~70 expression-evaluator functions across binding-where, case, comparison, operators, math, traversal, link-prediction, knowledge-policy, vector procs, and APOC helpers so `$param` references resolve at evaluate time inside `reduce()`, list comprehensions, `WHERE`, and every other expression context — no widening, no re-parse.

- **`db.index.vector.queryNodes` returns empty results with a WARN log on vector-disabled databases** instead of erroring or instantiating a fresh enabled service that bypasses the operator's flag. Composite Cypher pipelines that gracefully handle empty vector results continue to succeed; operators see the misconfiguration in `subsystem=vector_search` log lines.

- **Qdrant gRPC bridge honors the per-DB vector master switch.** External Qdrant clients querying a database with `NORNICDB_SEARCH_VECTOR_ENABLED=false` see a deterministic structured error rather than a service whose ANN substrate isn't populated.

### Fixed

- **`mcp-neo4j-memory` regressions — three independently reproducible Cypher correctness defects resolved.**
  1. **Map-parameter property access stored as literal text.** `WITH $entity AS entity MERGE (e:Memory {name: entity.name})` previously stored the literal string `"{name:'Alice', type:'Person'}.name"` instead of evaluating `entity.name`. The WITH-binding substitution treated `entity.<key>` as a standalone identifier and replaced just `entity`, leaving an orphaned `.name` suffix. Fixed by expanding `<ident>.<key>` into the property's Cypher literal value before the standalone-identifier replacer runs. Token boundary checks (word / underscore / dot) keep unrelated identifiers untouched. The same pattern in `UNWIND [$r] AS r MATCH (a),(b) WHERE a.name = r.source AND b.name = r.target MERGE (a)-[:REL]->(b)` now matches and creates the expected edge.

  2. **Aggregating RETURN after CALL…YIELD…WITH…WHERE returned 0 rows.** A bare `RETURN collect(...)` is required by Cypher to produce exactly one row even when the WHERE filters every input. The `MATCH-WITH-RETURN` aggregation path looked up `cr.values["entity.name"]` (a literal string keyed by alias) and silently produced an empty list when `collect(entity.name)` ran over it. New `resolveInnerForRow` evaluates each aggregate's inner expression three ways — bare alias, `alias.property` against a stored `*storage.Node`, or general expression with WITH-bound nodes as context — and applies uniformly to `count`, `sum`, and `collect`. WITH-followed-by-WHERE-followed-by-aggregating-RETURN now produces exactly one row holding the aggregation's identity value (`collect → []`, `count → 0`).

  3. **`CALL dbms.components()` reported hard-coded "1.0.0".** Wired to `pkg/buildinfo.Version()` (which loads from the embedded `VERSION` file at build time). Same fix applied to `dbms.listConfig`'s `nornicdb.version` row. `cypher-shell --version`-style probes now see the actual running binary version.

- **Cypher `SET` errors no longer silently swallowed.** A conflict-rejected `UpdateNode` / `UpdateEdge` previously looked like a successful SET to `ExecuteCypher` callers — the SET-RETURN row carried the pre-update state on disk while the executor reported success. Errors now propagate so MVCC commit conflicts surface as loud query failures instead of silent data loss. Paired with: `RebuildTemporalIndexes` + `RebuildMVCCHeads` moved from a background task into the synchronous tail of `Open()` so first-query writes can't race a startup head-rewrite that clears the entire `prefixMVCCNodeHead` range mid-commit.

- **DROP INDEX now tears down per-property vector data.** Previously `DROP INDEX <name>` only removed the schema entry, leaving per-property vector data orphaned in the in-memory `vectorIndex` / HNSW / cluster substrates. A subsequent `CREATE VECTOR INDEX` with the same name appeared to "do nothing" because the orphaned state shadowed the new one. New `search.Service.RemovePropertyVectorIndex` tears the in-memory state down; `executeDropIndex` calls it before returning so a recreate from scratch is clean.

- **WAL chunk recovery now batches snapshot restore.** `RecoverWithTransactions` and `RecoverFromWALWithResult` were calling `BulkCreateNodes` / `BulkCreateEdges` with the entire snapshot in one go, exhausting Badger's per-transaction write budget on snapshots above ~10 K nodes/edges. New `BulkCreateNodesForRecovery` / `BulkCreateEdgesForRecovery` chunk the restore into transaction-sized batches.

- **Search-flag precedence honored end-to-end.** Three independent gaps in the v1.1.1 search-flag contract caused operator-set values to be silently dropped at startup:
  1. `cmd/nornicdb/runServe` was hand-copying a subset of `cfg` fields into a fresh `nornicdb.DefaultConfig()`; the four `Search*` fields were missing from the copy block, so env+CLI values landed in `cfg` but never reached `dbConfig`. `dbConfig` is now an alias of `cfg` so any field added to `Config` flows through automatically.
  2. `nornicdb.Open` warmed search indexes in a background goroutine that raced `server.New`'s `SetDbSearchFlagsResolver`. When the resolver was nil at warmup time, default-DB warmup fell through to global defaults instead of per-DB overrides. New `Config.DeferSearchWarmup` + `db.MarkSearchWarmupReady` gate the warmup until the resolver is installed; `pkg/server` opts in.
  3. `applyEnvVars` unconditionally wrote `(true, "startup")` before checking the env var, breaking `LoadFromFile`'s precedence ladder — a YAML file setting `search_bm25_enabled: false` was silently overwritten when the env var was unset. The env path now only writes when the var is actually present.

  Operators who set `NORNICDB_SEARCH_BM25_ENABLED=false` (or the CLI / YAML equivalents) now see the flag honored from the first warmup line in the log.

- **Transactional `MATCH … MERGE` correctly routes before `CREATE`.** A regression where a `MERGE` inside a transaction containing a preceding `MATCH` was being dispatched to the `CREATE` path instead of the merge path is fixed. The dispatcher now consults `MERGE` keywords ahead of `CREATE`.

### Internal

- **38 deeply-asserted regression tests added** across `pkg/cypher` (13 in `mcp_memory_bugs_test.go` covering every shape from the bug report plus relationship-side parity), `pkg/storage` (6 in `schema_fulltext_relationship_test.go` proving forward + backward + idempotent persistence), `pkg/cypher/demo_shortest_path_bench_test.go` (latency distribution + three benchmarks), `pkg/storage/async_engine_edge_index_test.go` (edge-cache inverted index across CRUD + flush + bulk paths), `pkg/storage/async_engine_label_index_test.go` (labelIndex flush eviction, `GetNodesByLabel` cache+engine merge), and the search-flag suites (`pkg/search/index_flags_test.go` and `pkg/server/server_search_flags_test.go`).
- **CI: storage tests split into smaller test groups** so the runner doesn't exceed memory limits on shared CI hardware.
- **Bolt-side benchmarks**: `BenchmarkBolt_StreamRecords_EndToEnd_*` plus per-transport variants (`tcp`, `tcp_tls`, `ws`, `ws_tls`) ship as part of the regression suite.

### Documentation

### Technical Details

- **Range covered**: `v1.1.1..main` (31 commits)
- **Primary focus areas**: Bolt-over-WebSocket transport multiplexing with full TLS / origin / mTLS / cert-rotation surface, neo4j-driver browser-build integration in the embedded UI, per-DB search index master switches with synchronous lazy-warming, mcp-neo4j-memory Cypher parity (map-param property access, fulltext label/type scope, Lucene wildcard family, post-YIELD aggregation), shortestPath traversal latency reduction via per-node edge-cache indexes and parent-pointer BFS, typed property round-trip preservation through msgpack codec + Cypher param substitution, deterministic DROP INDEX teardown of vector substrates, WAL recovery batching for large snapshots.

## [v1.1.1] - 2026-05-19

Patch release focused on multi-tenant MVCC isolation, MERGE concurrency correctness, and a discoverable consumer-facing documentation surface (skills, migration scripts, unified Bolt error shape). No on-disk format changes; existing `v1.1.0` databases upgrade transparently.

### Added

- **`/demo` galaxy route** — interactive 3D force-directed graph (lazy-loaded `3d-force-graph` + `three.js`) that procedurally seeds a `d3_demo` database with a Fibonacci-sphere sector layout, links sectors via gateway hyperlanes, and exposes click-two-stars-to-traverse so the deep multi-hop `shortestPath` path lights up in purple. A purple-themed HUD tracks live `shortestPath` latency only — seed and catalog calls are excluded so the bars reflect query speed, not page load. All seed Cypher pinned to the hot-path cookbook (`UnwindSimpleMergeBatch` for stars, `UnwindMultiMatchCreateBatch` for hyperlanes).
- **Cancellable traversal** — `context.Context` threaded through `executeShortestPathQuery`, `shortestPath`, `allShortestPaths`, `traverseGraph`, `traverseGraphSequential`, `traverseGraphParallel`, `traverseFromNode`, and `findPaths`. Probes `ctx.Err()` once every 256 BFS dequeues / DFS recursive entries (power-of-two mask) so client disconnects and server shutdown unwind in-flight traversals promptly instead of blocking until `ReadTimeout`/`WriteTimeout` fires. BFS funcs now return errors on cancel.
- **Server graceful shutdown wired through to in-flight requests** — `http.Server.BaseContext` is linked to a shutdown-linked parent context so `Stop()` cancels every in-flight request's `r.Context()` before `httpServer.Shutdown` waits for handlers to drain. Combined with the cancellable BFS, graceful shutdown is now deterministic — stuck traversals no longer hold the server open.
- **List-comprehension shapes in shortestPath returns** — `pathToValue` now supports `[n IN nodes(p) | n.<prop>]`, `[r IN relationships(p) | type(r)]`, and the `id`/`elementId`/`labels` variants. Previously these returned `null`.

### Changed

- **MVCC commit-sequence sharded per database; transactions pinned to one namespace.** The MVCC counter and high-water timestamp clamp moved off `BadgerEngine` (engine-global) onto a per-namespace `namespaceMVCCState` map keyed by database name. Each transaction is pinned to a single namespace at the first prefixed write (or eagerly via `BadgerTransaction.SetNamespace`); cross-namespace writes return the new sentinel `ErrCrossNamespaceTransaction`. Snapshot-isolation conflict detection compares `CommitSequence` values that share a namespace by construction, so a noisy tenant can no longer interleave version numbers with another's, and `DROP DATABASE` drops its counter alongside its keys.
- **Lifecycle prune planner consults a per-namespace safe-floor callback** — cross-namespace counters aren't comparable, so a head in namespace A is now evaluated against namespace A's oldest reader, not the global minimum across every tenant. `ReaderRegistry.OldestReaderVersionsByNamespace()` groups readers by `info.Namespace` and returns the per-group minimum.
- **Property-key dictionary persistence is out-of-band.** Counter high-water marks and pending forward/reverse entries are drained at commit time and persisted in a fresh badger transaction so they don't enter the user txn's SSI read/write set. Without this, every property-writing commit in the same namespace would touch the same propkey counter key and concurrent first-allocation commits would race on Badger's optimistic conflict check, surfacing "Transaction Conflict" instead of the genuine constraint-violation shape.
- **Bolt commit-failure wrapper unified across both commit paths.** The implicit-autocommit path at `pkg/cypher/executor.go:1978` now produces `"commit failed: ..."` (matching the explicit `BEGIN/COMMIT` path at `pkg/cypher/transaction.go:181`) instead of the legacy `"failed to commit implicit transaction: ..."`. Downstream Bolt classifiers that match on the substring no longer need to handle two shapes for the same race.
- **Variable-length pattern parser default raised** — patterns without an upper bound (`[*]`, `[*N..]`) previously capped at `MaxHops=10/100`, so `shortestPath` silently returned no rows on graphs whose diameter exceeded the cap. The parser now uses `VarLengthUnboundedMaxHops = 1<<24` so BFS terminates when the frontier is exhausted instead of when the cap fires.

### Fixed

- **MERGE on a uniquely-constrained value is now deterministically idempotent under concurrent writers.** Two writers MERGE-ing on the same `uid` would intermittently surface Badger's generic `"Transaction Conflict"` (or, after the first round of fixes, an SI `"node ... changed after transaction start"` conflict) instead of the consumer-pinned commit-time UNIQUE shape — regression: `TestMERGE_IsIdempotentUnderConcurrentRetry`, ~3 % originally and ~0.05 % after the partial fix. Root cause has two coupled parts:
  1. **Read-set leak.** `writeNodeMVCCHeadInTxn` and the archive-pre-overwrite paths read `mvccNodeHeadKey` via the user txn to carry `FloorVersion` forward; that read entered Badger's SSI set, and a peer commit on the same head key forced a generic `Transaction Conflict`. Fixed by routing those reads through fresh read transactions (`loadNodeMVCCHead` / `loadEdgeMVCCHead`).
  2. **MERGE-MATCH redirect onto a peer.** When MERGE's MATCH (a fresh read-txn lookup) found a node a peer committed between begin and our pin, the subsequent `OpUpdateNode` ran on the peer's nodeID. `validateSnapshotIsolationConflicts` then fired `checkNodeWriteConflict` (head version > readTS) → ErrConflict. **The semantic cause is the consumer-pinned commit-time UNIQUE race**, not a generic SI conflict, so the storage layer now reclassifies: when an OpUpdate hits an SI conflict on a nodeID whose pending body carries a uniquely-constrained value already mapped to that nodeID in the schema's UNIQUE-value cache, `checkNodeWriteConflict` returns a `ConstraintViolationError{Type: ConstraintUnique, Cause: ErrConflict}` and the commit path wraps it as `commit failed: constraint violation: … already exists`. The transient classifier still fires via the `Cause` chain, so retry-aware drivers see the documented retry sentinel. Verified at 50,000 stress iterations: zero non-deterministic failures.
- **Snapshot isolation broken for transactions that read before any write.** The earlier per-namespace MVCC refactor lazy-pinned `tx.readTS` to the namespace's CURRENT sequence at first prefixed read/write — which let peer commits that landed between begin and pin become visible. That broke anchored snapshot reads (`TestTransaction_Isolation`, `TestTransaction_ReadYourWritesDoesNotBreakAnchoredSnapshot`) and the SI conflict checks for concurrent CREATE on the same ID (`TestCheckNodeCreateConflict_ConcurrentWriteAfterReadTS`, `TestCheckEdgeCreateConflict_ConcurrentWriteAfterReadTS`). Fixed: `BeginTransaction` now snapshots every namespace's sequence into `tx.beginSnapshot`; lazy pin binds readTS to the begin-time entry instead of the current one. Namespaces created after begin pin to seq=0 (correctly invisible).
- **Snapshot-invisible reads no longer leak via the legacy fallback.** `GetNodeVisibleAt` / `GetEdgeVisibleAt` now return the new `ErrNotVisibleAtSnapshot` sentinel when a head exists but the caller's snapshot can't see it, distinct from `ErrNotFound` (no head at all). `getCommittedNodeLocked` falls back to a primary-key read only on the latter — the former is a hard miss. Without this, the badger-snapshot fallback would expose a peer's post-begin commit on every visibility-rejected read.
- **`discover` returned the outer RRF rank score in `similarity`, not cosine.** The `discover` MCP/Heimdall paths overwrote `similarity` with `1 / (60 + rank)` (≈ 0.0164 at rank 1, 0.0091 at rank 50). Because that score depends only on rank position, every query returned an identical top-to-bottom sequence regardless of content, making the `min_similarity` threshold useless: any caller setting it above ~0.02 silently filtered everything; any caller setting it to 0 had no filter at all. Both paths now track `bestSim` (the strongest underlying score across chunks) and surface that as `similarity` while keeping outer RRF for sort order. The BM25-only fallback in `pkg/mcp` also now reads `r.Similarity` instead of `r.Score`. Two new regression tests pin the cosine-vs-RRF distinction: `TestHandleDiscover_SimilarityIsCosineNotRRF` and `TestQueryExecutor_Discover_SimilarityIsBestScore`.
- **`shortestPath` parameter substitution** — params were being substituted _after_ parsing, so `MATCH (start:Star {starId: $startId})` matched the literal string `"$startId"` against every node, fell through to `AllNodes() × AllNodes()` BFS, and hung. Substitution now runs before parsing in both the executor and transaction dispatchers; unresolved variables now refuse rather than fall through.

### Internal

- **`ConstraintViolationError` carries a `Cause` field** with `Unwrap` so the storage layer can synthesize a unique-constraint violation from a commit-window peer race while preserving `errors.Is(err, ErrConflict)` for transient classification. `errors`-package wrappers and downstream Bolt classifiers continue to work unchanged.
- **`pkg/storage/db.go` removed.** The `*storage.DB.Update` helper embedded a `for attempt := 0; attempt < maxRetries; attempt++ { … }` retry loop in the storage layer, which violates the consumer-pinned contract: retries are the consumer's responsibility (Bolt drivers retry on the documented transient sentinels; the cypher executor does not retry). The helper had zero non-test callers and only existed to test itself. The contract is now: `engine.BeginTransaction()` → `tx.Commit()` returns the documented error; the caller decides whether to replay.
- **Cross-namespace transactions: invariant enforced, dead branches deleted.** Production never opened a transaction whose pending writes spanned multiple namespaces; the cypher executor's `transactionStorageWrapper` and the explicit-tx path both pin a single namespace at construction. The defensive multi-namespace branches in `acquireUniqueConstraintCommitLocks`, `validateNodeConstraints`, `checkUniqueConstraint`, `checkNodeKeyConstraint`, `checkTemporalConstraint`, `validateEdgeConstraints`, and `validatePolicyOnNodeLabelChange` were unreachable. All of those paths now look up the schema once from `tx.namespace` instead of re-parsing the prefix off each entity ID.
- **22 deterministic tests added** across `pkg/storage` and `pkg/storage/lifecycle` covering namespace pinning, per-namespace counters, high-water isolation, sequence saturation fallback, legacy seed migration, per-namespace prune floors, and the lost-update regression.
- **Five new consumer-error-contract regression tests** so the wire shape can't drift again: `RefreshUniqueConstraintValuesForEngine` keeps storage-prefixed IDs under `NamespacedEngine`; the five canonical optimistic-conflict messages (node, node-with-version-detail, edge, edge-alternate, adjacent-edge) plus `errors.Is(err, ErrConflict)` chain preservation; node + relationship variants of `commit failed: constraint violation: … already exists`; MERGE-loser sees the pinned wire shape and a retry succeeds with its `SET` visible; `LoadDefaults()` returns documented values for `Database.AsyncWritesEnabled=true`, `Database.PersistSearchIndexes=false`, `Auth.Enabled=false`, `Server.BoltPort=7687`, `Server.HTTPPort=7474`. Each pinned source-of-truth line gained a `// Wire contract:` comment.
- **CI server package split** — `pkg/server` tests are split during CI to use less resources.

### Documentation

- **`docs/skills/` — agent-ready skill files** for every consumer-facing surface: hot-path Cypher cookbook, Bolt client, gRPC (Qdrant + NornicSearch), Qdrant migration, Neo4j migration, knowledge policies, decay tuning, promotion policies, managed embeddings, vector & full-text search, RAG procedures.
- **Knowledge-policy user guides rewritten** with disambiguated bundle-vs-binding language: bundles are inert parameter packages; bindings carry the `FOR` target; decay is pure time math evaluated on read; `ON ACCESS` belongs to promotion only; `LAST_ACCESSED` decay only reads access metadata.
- **Documentation site consolidated to 8 top-level groups** (was 14). Every published `.md` is now in `nav:`, fixing the bug where clicking a search result loaded the content but left the sidebar empty. Canonical URLs emit on every page; URL ↔ sidebar ↔ content stay synchronized when navigating from a search result.
- **Documentation audit pass** — fixed stale env vars (`NORNICDB_NO_AUTH` → `NORNICDB_AUTH=none`, `NORNICDB_EMBEDDING_URL` → `NORNICDB_EMBEDDING_API_URL`) across development/setup, compliance/rbac, operations/deployment, troubleshooting, low-memory-mode, getting-started; corrected Material/MkDocs anchor slugs (single-dash, not double-dash) in `decay-profiles.md`, `operations/troubleshooting.md`, and twelve self-references in `release-notes-since-v1.0.11.md`; removed false `cache: true` claims for `db.infer` in `cypher-rag-procedures.md`. `mkdocs build` runs clean with zero anchor or broken-link warnings.
- **Skills aligned to verified parser/executor behavior** — knowledge-policies skill now states the actual binding-resolution tie-break (lower `Order` wins; equal-`Order` against the same target is a build error); the misleading `ALTER PROMOTION POLICY ... SET OPTIONS { ... }` example was removed (the executor only honors `enabled` on policies); `nornicdb.knowledgepolicy.resolve()` is documented as a dry-run with empty access metadata; `db.rerank` is documented as pass-through (not error) when no reranker is configured.

### Tools & Scripts

- **`scripts/migration/neo4j/{migrate.py,migrate.go,migrate.mjs}`** — runnable Neo4j → NornicDB migrations in Python, Go, and Node. Schema-first (constraints + indexes including fulltext and vector), then nodes via `UnwindSimpleMergeBatch`, then edges via `UnwindMultiMatchCreateBatch`. Keyset-paginated by `elementId`. Preserves source IDs on `_neo4j_id` and original labels on `_neo4j_labels` for an operator-driven label promotion pass.
- **`scripts/migration/qdrant/{migrate.py,migrate.go,migrate.mjs}`** — runnable Qdrant → NornicDB migrations. Python and Go use the Qdrant-compatible gRPC surface end-to-end; the Node script reads from Qdrant over REST and writes into NornicDB over Bolt (each point becomes a node with its vector and payload), since NornicDB has no Qdrant-compatible REST surface and there's no maintained JS gRPC client. Replicates collection vector configs, scrolls and upserts points in batches, verifies counts.
- All Go scripts vet and build clean against `github.com/qdrant/go-client v1.18.1` and `github.com/neo4j/neo4j-go-driver/v5 v5.28.4`.

### Technical Details

- **Range covered**: `v1.1.0..main`
- **Primary focus areas**: per-namespace MVCC isolation with begin-time snapshots, deterministic MERGE-under-contention semantics (no spurious Badger SSI conflicts for commit-time UNIQUE losers; no readTS lazy-jump that hides peer commits from anchored snapshots), discoverable consumer documentation surface (skills + migration scripts + unified Bolt error shape), and `discover` similarity-vs-RRF correctness.

## [v1.1.0] - 2026-05-14

# ⚠️ Breaking rolling upgrade changes to storage in this release. BACK UP YOUR DATA ⚠️

## Running the database requires using the `--upgrade-storage` option or in the macOS installer using the checkbox on the first run wizard, or in the tray settings panel restarting with the flag enabled. after your files are updated in place, older versions of the database will not be able to read the datafiles properly. This change is to compact the storage. after this, hopefully there shouldn't be any major overhauls to storage 🤞

### Added

- **Property pre-filter for hybrid search REST endpoint**:
  - added an optional `filters` field to `POST /nornicdb/search` that restricts the candidate set by property values _before_ top-K vector/BM25 selection, preserving recall for sparse filtered sets.
  - filter semantics: OR within a key (`{"collection": ["user_a", "user_b"]}`), AND across keys (`{"collection": ["user_a"], "type": ["text"]}`); scalar and array property values both supported.
  - filter applied in `rrfHybridSearch`, `vectorSearchOnly`, and `fullTextSearchOnly` paths.
  - primary use case: multi-tenant RAG where each node carries a `collection` array identifying which users may access it.

- **Knowledge-policy decay model support**:
  - added support for inverted Ebbinghaus-style decay curves in knowledge-policy scoring.

- **Storage migration observability**:
  - added more robust migration progress/statistics logging to improve operator visibility during upgrades.

### Changed

- **Storage serialization defaults and upgrade posture**:
  - removed Gob as an active serializer while preserving forward migration support for older data that was written using Gob.

- **Storage keying internals**:
  - introduced a per-namespace property-key dictionary as part of the storage-v2 path.

### Fixed

- **Hybrid search filter edge case**:
  - fixed empty filter-list handling so requests with empty filter lists no longer discard all results.

- **Cypher parsing and transaction conflict behavior**:
  - fixed `NOT IN` parsing behavior in the Cypher path.
  - adjusted transaction timing in conflict-sensitive paths to reduce avoidable write conflicts.

- **Knowledge-policy `ON ACCESS` arithmetic coercion**:
  - fixed runtime type coercion to align with Cypher DDL expectations.

- **Knowledge-policy `ON ACCESS` recording scope**:
  - moved `ON ACCESS` recording out of storage visibility checks to trigger only for entities actually materialized into query results.
  - routed recording through storage wrappers to preserve namespaced IDs correctly.
  - extended e2e coverage with positive and inverse test cases including accumulator contents before flush.

- **MVCC commit ordering at sequence saturation**:
  - hardened MVCC commit ordering when the global commit sequence reaches `MaxUint64`.
  - The reason for the monotonic counter is that we can actually record transactions so fast that slower processors can have negative nanos drift causing random conflicts with serial ingesiton. @1 million commits/sec it would exhaust in 584.5 million years. @1 billion/sec - 584,500 years.
  - keep sequence pinned and fall back to strictly increasing high-water timestamps rather than wrapping or failing in said years.
  - updated snapshot conflict detection to use timestamp ordering only for the saturated equal-sequence case.
  - added focused regression tests for the saturation fallback.

- **Merge-conflict error surfacing for clients**:
  - fixed unique-merge conflict handling so retryable conflict errors are surfaced and scoped correctly for Bolt clients.

- **Migration index completeness**:
  - fixed storage migration so expected indexes are created during migration.

- **Lifecycle and fast-write clock handling**:
  - fixed lifecycle and high-watermark nanosecond timing bugs affecting fast-write scenarios.

### Documentation

- Added and refreshed:
  - memory-decay and decay-profile documentation for the new inverted decay behavior and documented scenarios
  - user guidance around promotion policy and Ebbinghaus/Roynard bootstrap behavior

### Technical Details

- **Range covered**: `v1.1.0-preview-1..main`
- **Commits in range**: 29 (non-merge)
- **Repository delta**: 154 files changed, +105,380 / -1,336 lines
- **Primary focus areas**: hybrid search pre-filtering, conflict and parsing correctness, storage-v2 migration and serializer evolution, and knowledge-policy decay/scoring improvements.

## [v1.1.0-preview] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Cypher-native knowledge policy administration**:
  - added `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, and `SHOW` support for knowledge-policy management so decay and promotion behavior can be administered directly through Cypher.
  - added built-in `CALL nornicdb.knowledgepolicy.*` procedures for inspecting policy state, profiles, resolution, and deindexing status.
  - added the corresponding browser-side management flow so the policy UI now works against the Cypher-backed surface instead of a separate admin API.

- **Knowledge lifecycle scoring and visibility control**:
  - added the new knowledge-policy runtime model, including shared profile resolution, access metadata indexing, scoring-before-visibility, and suppression/deindex infrastructure.
  - added Cypher functions for policy-aware scoring and diagnostics, including `decayScore`, `decay`, and `policy`.

- **End-to-end observability stack**:
  - added OpenTelemetry tracing across HTTP, Cypher planning and execution, Bolt sessions, storage operations, embeddings, and search flows.
  - added Helm chart support for observability deployment, including `ServiceMonitor`, `PodMonitor`, startup/readiness/liveness probes, and default network-policy wiring.
  - added a curated Grafana dashboard, Prometheus alert rules, and an auto-generated metrics reference covering the current exported metric catalog.
  - added pprof hooks for goroutine and mutex profiling to make production debugging easier.

- **More compact storage internals**:
  - added internal numerical IDs and a freelist-based key reclamation path to reduce storage overhead while keeping keys monotonic and reusable.

### Changed

- **Knowledge-policy operator surface**:
  - moved knowledge-policy administration away from the dedicated HTTP API surface and onto the new Cypher DDL and procedure model.
  - aligned the admin UI, runtime behavior, and diagnostics around the new suppression-anchor and decay-profile model.

- **Write-heavy query execution**:
  - expanded and tuned bulk-insert and canonical write paths so more high-volume ingestion shapes avoid unnecessary reads and stay on optimized execution paths.
  - refreshed the bulk-insert cookbook and related operator guidance to match the current fast-path behavior.

- **Management UI grid behavior**:
  - updated the browser management pages to use newer `uiGrid` capabilities for database and retention administration views.

- **Local LLM runtime bits**:
  - upgraded the bundled `llama.cpp` integration to `b9106`.

### Fixed

- **Knowledge-policy correctness and stability**:
  - fixed decay diagnostics, targeted suppression invalidation, score-argument handling, and reveal-path correctness.
  - hardened embed/reveal worker concurrency so the new knowledge lifecycle features behave predictably under load.

- **Storage metadata and schema recovery**:
  - fixed MVCC schema metadata recovery, edge-between deindexing behavior, and schema lock leak scenarios.
  - tightened uniqueness-vs-constraint-contract handling in the affected storage and Cypher paths.

- **Observability safety**:
  - fixed trace redaction and baggage filtering so credentials and other sensitive values are not emitted into spans.
  - fixed nil-pointer and span-property edge cases in the observability pipeline.

- **Cross-platform build and packaging reliability**:
  - fixed Windows and macOS build and packaging regressions that were affecting release CI and local packaging flows.

### Compatibility

- **MVCC is now opt-in by default**:
  - the default retained-version count is now `0`, which disables MVCC history unless explicitly enabled in configuration.

### Documentation

- Added and refreshed:
  - the metrics reference generated from the current observability catalog
  - Helm, dashboard, and alerting guidance for the new observability stack
  - knowledge-policy and decay diagnostics documentation aligned to the Cypher-backed administration model
  - bulk-insert cookbook material for the current optimized write paths

### Technical Details

- **Range covered**: `v1.0.45..HEAD`
- **Commits in range**: 62 (non-merge)
- **Repository delta**: 490 files changed, +65,079 / -8,480 lines
- **Primary focus areas**: knowledge-policy lifecycle management, full-stack observability, storage compaction and write-path performance, cross-platform packaging reliability, and release-facing documentation.
