## [v1.1.0] - 2026-05-14

# ⚠️ Breaking rolling upgrade changes to storage in this release. BACK UP YOUR DATA ⚠️

## Running the database requires using the `--upgrade-storage` option or in the macOS installer using the checkbox on the first run wizard, or in the tray settings panel restarting with the flag enabled. after your files are updated in place, older versions of the database will not be able to read the datafiles properly. This change is to compact the storage. after this, hopefully there shouldn't be any major overhauls to storage 🤞

### Added

- **Property pre-filter for hybrid search REST endpoint**:
  - added an optional `filters` field to `POST /nornicdb/search` that restricts the candidate set by property values _before_ top-K vector/BM25 selection, preserving recall for sparse filtered sets.
  - filter semantics: OR within a key (`{"collection": ["user_a", "user_b"]}`), AND across keys (`{"collection": ["user_a"], "type": ["text"]}`); scalar and array property values both supported.
  - filter applied in `rrfHybridSearch`, `vectorSearchOnly`, and `fullTextSearchOnly` paths.
  - primary use case: multi-tenant RAG where each node carries a `collection` array identifying which users may access it.

- **Knowledge-policy decay model support**:
  - added support for inverted Ebbinghaus-style decay curves in knowledge-policy scoring.

- **Storage migration observability**:
  - added more robust migration progress/statistics logging to improve operator visibility during upgrades.

### Changed

- **Storage serialization defaults and upgrade posture**:
  - removed Gob as an active serializer while preserving forward migration support for older data that was written using Gob.

- **Storage keying internals**:
  - introduced a per-namespace property-key dictionary as part of the storage-v2 path.

### Fixed

- **Hybrid search filter edge case**:
  - fixed empty filter-list handling so requests with empty filter lists no longer discard all results.

- **Cypher parsing and transaction conflict behavior**:
  - fixed `NOT IN` parsing behavior in the Cypher path.
  - adjusted transaction timing in conflict-sensitive paths to reduce avoidable write conflicts.

- **Knowledge-policy `ON ACCESS` arithmetic coercion**:
  - fixed runtime type coercion to align with Cypher DDL expectations.

- **Knowledge-policy `ON ACCESS` recording scope**:
  - moved `ON ACCESS` recording out of storage visibility checks to trigger only for entities actually materialized into query results.
  - routed recording through storage wrappers to preserve namespaced IDs correctly.
  - extended e2e coverage with positive and inverse test cases including accumulator contents before flush.

- **MVCC commit ordering at sequence saturation**:
  - hardened MVCC commit ordering when the global commit sequence reaches `MaxUint64`.
  - The reason for the monotonic counter is that we can actually record transactions so fast that slower processors can have negative nanos drift causing random conflicts with serial ingesiton. @1 million commits/sec it would exhaust in 584.5 million years. @1 billion/sec - 584,500 years.
  - keep sequence pinned and fall back to strictly increasing high-water timestamps rather than wrapping or failing in said years.
  - updated snapshot conflict detection to use timestamp ordering only for the saturated equal-sequence case.
  - added focused regression tests for the saturation fallback.

- **Merge-conflict error surfacing for clients**:
  - fixed unique-merge conflict handling so retryable conflict errors are surfaced and scoped correctly for Bolt clients.

- **Migration index completeness**:
  - fixed storage migration so expected indexes are created during migration.

- **Lifecycle and fast-write clock handling**:
  - fixed lifecycle and high-watermark nanosecond timing bugs affecting fast-write scenarios.

### Documentation

- Added and refreshed:
  - memory-decay and decay-profile documentation for the new inverted decay behavior and documented scenarios
  - user guidance around promotion policy and Ebbinghaus/Roynard bootstrap behavior

## [v1.1.0-preview] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Cypher-native knowledge policy administration**:
  - added `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, and `SHOW` support for knowledge-policy management so decay and promotion behavior can be administered directly through Cypher.
  - added built-in `CALL nornicdb.knowledgepolicy.*` procedures for inspecting policy state, profiles, resolution, and deindexing status.
  - added the corresponding browser-side management flow so the policy UI now works against the Cypher-backed surface instead of a separate admin API.

- **Knowledge lifecycle scoring and visibility control**:
  - added the new knowledge-policy runtime model, including shared profile resolution, access metadata indexing, scoring-before-visibility, and suppression/deindex infrastructure.
  - added Cypher functions for policy-aware scoring and diagnostics, including `decayScore`, `decay`, and `policy`.

- **End-to-end observability stack**:
  - added OpenTelemetry tracing across HTTP, Cypher planning and execution, Bolt sessions, storage operations, embeddings, and search flows.
  - added Helm chart support for observability deployment, including `ServiceMonitor`, `PodMonitor`, startup/readiness/liveness probes, and default network-policy wiring.
  - added a curated Grafana dashboard, Prometheus alert rules, and an auto-generated metrics reference covering the current exported metric catalog.
  - added pprof hooks for goroutine and mutex profiling to make production debugging easier.

- **More compact storage internals**:
  - added internal numerical IDs and a freelist-based key reclamation path to reduce storage overhead while keeping keys monotonic and reusable.

### Changed

- **Knowledge-policy operator surface**:
  - moved knowledge-policy administration away from the dedicated HTTP API surface and onto the new Cypher DDL and procedure model.
  - aligned the admin UI, runtime behavior, and diagnostics around the new suppression-anchor and decay-profile model.

- **Write-heavy query execution**:
  - expanded and tuned bulk-insert and canonical write paths so more high-volume ingestion shapes avoid unnecessary reads and stay on optimized execution paths.
  - refreshed the bulk-insert cookbook and related operator guidance to match the current fast-path behavior.

- **Management UI grid behavior**:
  - updated the browser management pages to use newer `uiGrid` capabilities for database and retention administration views.

- **Local LLM runtime bits**:
  - upgraded the bundled `llama.cpp` integration to `b9106`.

### Fixed

- **Knowledge-policy correctness and stability**:
  - fixed decay diagnostics, targeted suppression invalidation, score-argument handling, and reveal-path correctness.
  - hardened embed/reveal worker concurrency so the new knowledge lifecycle features behave predictably under load.

- **Storage metadata and schema recovery**:
  - fixed MVCC schema metadata recovery, edge-between deindexing behavior, and schema lock leak scenarios.
  - tightened uniqueness-vs-constraint-contract handling in the affected storage and Cypher paths.

- **Observability safety**:
  - fixed trace redaction and baggage filtering so credentials and other sensitive values are not emitted into spans.
  - fixed nil-pointer and span-property edge cases in the observability pipeline.

- **Cross-platform build and packaging reliability**:
  - fixed Windows and macOS build and packaging regressions that were affecting release CI and local packaging flows.

### Compatibility

- **MVCC is now opt-in by default**:
  - the default retained-version count is now `0`, which disables MVCC history unless explicitly enabled in configuration.

### Documentation

- Added and refreshed:
  - the metrics reference generated from the current observability catalog
  - Helm, dashboard, and alerting guidance for the new observability stack
  - knowledge-policy and decay diagnostics documentation aligned to the Cypher-backed administration model
  - bulk-insert cookbook material for the current optimized write paths

### Technical Details

## [v1.0.45] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Broader hot-path coverage for `UNWIND MATCH SET` updates**:
  - added a batched `UNWIND` + `MATCH` + `SET` hot path so more update-heavy Cypher write workloads can stay on the optimized execution path.

### Changed

- **Browser query-results grid behavior**:
  - updated the web UI to `@ornery/ui-grid-*` `1.0.5`, bringing the latest resize and scroll tracking behavior from the new grid runtime.
  - query-results selection now relies on the grid's per-column opt-out behavior for the synthetic Select column, so hidden sort and group controls follow the legacy ui-grid behavior instead of rendering as disabled header buttons.

- **Cypher write-path routing**:
  - tightened `MATCH ... SET` hot-path routing so optimized update execution only applies when uniqueness guarantees are present, reducing incorrect fast-path routing for ambiguous match shapes.

- **Maintenance and dependency refreshes**:
  - refreshed UI grid dependencies from the `1.0.4` line to `1.0.5` and regenerated the UI lockfile to match the published package graph.
  - updated package metadata and peer-dependency wiring in the UI package so installs resolve cleanly against the latest grid release.
  - folded in mainline merge-conflict cleanup that affected the release range.

### Fixed

- **Embedding worker lifecycle stability**:
  - fixed overlapping embed-worker reset and close flows by serializing worker lifecycle transitions, preventing wait-group reuse panics during concurrent embedding workloads.

- **Grid column opt-out chrome**:
  - fixed the query-results Select column so column-level sorting and grouping opt-outs now hide header controls using the grid's native per-column behavior instead of relying on CSS workarounds.

## [v1.0.42-hotfix] Anthem Pt. 2 - 2026-04-17

### Added

- **Explicit Bolt host binding support**:
  - added a dedicated Bolt host field so the Bolt listener can bind to the resolved server address instead of always falling back to the wildcard socket.

- **Bind-address regression coverage**:
  - added CLI/config/environment precedence tests for server bind resolution.
  - added Bolt listener tests to verify loopback binding and secure default host behavior.

### Changed

- **Bind-address resolution precedence**:
  - centralized bind-address resolution for `serve` startup so CLI flags, loaded config, and explicit protocol-specific environment variables are resolved consistently before HTTP and Bolt are started.
  - aligned startup endpoint display output with the resolved address, while still presenting `localhost` for wildcard binds in user-facing logs.

- **Dependency maintenance**:
  - updated `github.com/hybridgroup/yzma` to `v1.12.0`.
  - refreshed related Go module entries pulled in by the dependency update.
  - updated UI dev dependencies: `postcss` to `8.5.10` and `typescript` to `6.0.3`.

### Fixed

- **Bolt listener exposure**:
  - fixed the Bolt server so configured bind addresses now apply to the actual listener instead of only affecting user-facing startup messages.
  - restored secure loopback binding as the default when no explicit override is provided.

### Tests

## [v1.0.40] "Kiyote" by rumspringa - 2026-04-11

### Added

- **Structured Cypher hot-path matchers**:
  - replaced several regex-based fast-path routers with scanner/helper-based matchers for compound queries, `UNWIND` routes, traversal shapes, shortest-path handling, and related query-shape detection.
  - added explicit hot-path trace coverage so the executor can report when the new structured matchers are used.

- **Parser comparison reporting**:
  - added an integrated Nornic-vs-ANTLR comparison harness that prints per-query timing ratios and an overall summary.
  - stabilized the comparison output so users and maintainers can trust the speedup numbers instead of single-run noise.

### Changed

- **Traversal and match planning**:
  - improved traversal planning for top-k seeded lookups so multi-key `ORDER BY` shapes can still use the indexed path when possible.
  - compiled common binding-row `WHERE` predicates and made traversal execution honor the active temporal viewport consistently.
  - refined MERGE routing for composite-key patterns and hardened batch deduplication so key collisions are handled predictably.

- **Cypher execution cleanup**:
  - migrated hot-path query-shape parsing away from regex capture arrays and onto shared helpers.
  - removed obsolete hot-path regex definitions after the structured matcher cutover.
  - refreshed parser-mode and query-pattern plumbing so the same user-facing queries route more consistently across executor paths.

- **Documentation and release hygiene**:
  - refreshed README and deployment notes to reflect the current product direction.
  - updated performance notes for hybrid Bolt queries.
  - refreshed dependencies as part of the release cycle.

### Fixed

  - added regression coverage for the exact Bolt fallback query shape that exposed the issue.

- **Query-shape stability**:
  - restored deterministic ordering and route selection for the query families that were being optimized in the hot path.
  - tightened parser and traversal tests around the new helper-based implementations.

## [v1.0.39] "Punkrocker" - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **Block-style constraint contracts (`REQUIRE { ... }`)**:
  - added grouped schema contracts so multiple rules can be declared together on a node or relationship target.
  - block entries can mix primitive constraints already supported by the engine with runtime boolean validations.
  - added `SHOW CONSTRAINT CONTRACTS` to inspect stored contracts separately from the compiled primitive constraints they generate.

Example - node contract:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT person_contract
FOR (n:Person)
REQUIRE {
  n.id IS UNIQUE
  n.name IS NOT NULL
  n.status IN ['active', 'inactive']
  (n.tenant, n.externalId) IS NODE KEY
  COUNT { (n)-[:PRIMARY_EMPLOYER]->(:Company) } <= 1
}
```

Example - relationship contract:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT works_at_contract
FOR ()-[r:WORKS_AT]-()
REQUIRE {
  r.id IS UNIQUE
  r.startedAt IS NOT NULL
  startNode(r) <> endNode(r)
  startNode(r).tenant = endNode(r).tenant
  r.hoursPerWeek > 0
}
```

- **Relationship cardinality and endpoint policy constraints (NornicDB extensions)**:
  - added directional relationship cardinality limits using `REQUIRE MAX COUNT <n>`.
  - added endpoint policy constraints so allowed start-label/end-label combinations can be enforced for a relationship type.

Example - directional cardinality:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT max_employers
FOR ()-[r:WORKS_AT]->()
REQUIRE MAX COUNT 3
```

### Changed

- **Cypher parser compatibility and DDL coverage**:
  - expanded ANTLR parser support for Neo4j 5-style `REQUIRE` forms, parenthesized property chains in key constraints, trailing `OPTIONS`, and `WITH EMBEDDING` syntax.
  - aligned parser-mode behavior so the same user-facing query shapes work consistently in both parser paths.

- **Traversal planning and query execution**:
  - added a generic relationship `ORDER BY ... LIMIT` planner that can seed traversal from the filtered end-node side using index top-k lookups.
  - added dedicated hot-path tracing for the new traversal planner and broadened routing/coverage for the translation-query family and adjacent query shapes.

- **Release and dependency maintenance**:
  - refreshed Go, UI, and workflow dependencies.
  - updated release/readme/docs content to reflect the current feature set and release flow.

### Fixed

- **Explicit transaction final-state semantics**:
  - fixed explicit transaction handling so relationship constraints are validated against the final committed state rather than intermediate statement state.
  - fixed transaction read-your-own-write behavior for relationship reads and relationship property updates in explicit transactions.

- **Large batch write amplification**:
  - fixed `UNWIND`/bulk write paths that could fail with oversized transactions when a node was created and then updated again in the same transaction.
  - create-then-update mutations now collapse into a single pending create operation where possible.

- **Relationship query ordering and stability**:
  - fixed `ORDER BY` handling for relationship query results when ordering by aliased return expressions or node properties.
  - fixed MATCH-clause `ORDER BY` extraction so labels and relationship types such as `:Order` and `:ORDERS` no longer interfere with sorting.
  - restored deterministic ordering for Northwind-style relationship aggregation fast paths.

### Tests

- Added and expanded regression coverage for:
  - block-style constraint contracts and `SHOW CONSTRAINT CONTRACTS`
  - relationship cardinality and endpoint policy constraints
  - explicit transaction relationship final-state validation
  - batch `UNWIND` create/update collapse behavior
  - exact translation query-family parsing, routing, e2e behavior, and traversal hot-path assertions
  - relationship aggregation ordering and `ORDER BY` clause parsing around `Order`/`ORDERS` tokens

- **Commits in range**: 19 (non-merge)
- **Repository delta**: 85 files changed, +7,997 / -2,854 lines
- **Primary focus areas**: schema contracts and relationship policy constraints, parser compatibility, explicit transaction correctness, bulk-write stability, and generic relationship traversal/query hot paths.

## [v1.0.38] "Phantom" - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **Neo4j relationship constraint parity**:
  - all constraint families now work on both nodes and relationships: uniqueness, existence (IS NOT NULL), property type (IS :: TYPE), and key constraints (IS RELATIONSHIP KEY).
  - relationship constraints use the `FOR ()-[r:TYPE]-()` target pattern, matching Neo4j 5.x syntax.
  - uniqueness and key constraints on relationships automatically create owned backing indexes that are dropped when the constraint is dropped.

Example — relationship uniqueness:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT transfer_ref_unique IF NOT EXISTS
FOR ()-[r:TRANSFERRED]-()
REQUIRE r.reference_id IS UNIQUE
```

Example — relationship existence:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT transferred_amount_exists IF NOT EXISTS
FOR ()-[r:TRANSFERRED]-()
REQUIRE r.amount IS NOT NULL
```

Example — relationship property type:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT transferred_amount_type IF NOT EXISTS
FOR ()-[r:TRANSFERRED]-()
REQUIRE r.amount IS :: FLOAT
```

Example — relationship key (composite uniqueness + existence):

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT works_at_key IF NOT EXISTS
FOR ()-[r:WORKS_AT]-()
REQUIRE (r.employee_id, r.department) IS RELATIONSHIP KEY
```

- **Temporal no-overlap constraints on relationships (NornicDB extension)**:
  - extends the existing node temporal no-overlap constraint to relationships.
  - supports a composite endpoint-pair form where the last two properties are always the time range and any preceding properties form the grouping key.

Example — 3-property form (single grouping key):

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT employment_temporal IF NOT EXISTS
FOR ()-[r:WORKS_AT]-()
REQUIRE (r.employee_id, r.valid_from, r.valid_to) IS TEMPORAL NO OVERLAP
```

Example — 4-property form (composite grouping key):

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT assignment_temporal IF NOT EXISTS
FOR ()-[r:ASSIGNED_TO]-()
REQUIRE (r.employee_id, r.project_id, r.valid_from, r.valid_to) IS TEMPORAL NO OVERLAP
```

- **Domain/enum constraints (NornicDB extension)**:
  - new constraint type that restricts a property to a fixed set of allowed values.
  - works on both nodes and relationships.
  - domain constraints with different allowed-value sets on the same schema are treated as conflicting.

Example — node domain:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT person_status_domain IF NOT EXISTS
FOR (n:Person)
REQUIRE n.status IN ['active', 'inactive', 'suspended']
```

Example — relationship domain:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT works_at_role_domain IF NOT EXISTS
FOR ()-[r:WORKS_AT]-()
REQUIRE r.role IN ['engineer', 'manager', 'director']
```

- **CMEK/HSM-backed at-rest encryption**:
  - added customer-managed encryption key (CMEK) and HSM-backed at-rest encryption for the database engine.

- **macOS installer service lifecycle**:
  - added macOS packager workflow with automatic release upload.
  - separated macOS packager from Docker CD pipeline.

### Changed

- **`IF NOT EXISTS` semantics for `CREATE CONSTRAINT`**:
  - exact-duplicate `CREATE CONSTRAINT` now returns an error unless `IF NOT EXISTS` is specified, matching Neo4j behavior. Previously, duplicates were silently idempotent.

- **`SHOW INDEXES` and `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` relationship awareness**:
  - `SHOW INDEXES` now reports `entityType` (NODE or RELATIONSHIP) and `owningConstraint` for backing indexes created by relationship uniqueness/key constraints.
  - `SHOW CONSTRAINTS` now reports `entityType` as RELATIONSHIP for relationship-scoped constraints.

- **Branding and documentation**:
  - abstracted Mimir-specific references to NornicDB-focused language across docs, source comments, test files, and configuration.
  - updated system-design documentation with WITH EMBEDDING support and correct embedding defaults (8192 chunk size, bge-m3 model).
  - updated user-facing documentation for all new constraint types with syntax examples.

### Fixed

- **Embedding property namespace pollution**:
  - removed special-case routing that intercepted the `embedding` property name during SET/GET operations. The `embedding` property is now treated as a regular user property. Users can name their embedding fields anything and create vector indexes for them.

- **ORDER BY on returned node properties**:
  - stabilized ORDER BY when sorting on properties of returned nodes (e.g., `ORDER BY t.createdAt` when only `t` is returned).
  - fixed row-sorting to resolve `var.prop` against map-backed node values the same way expression evaluation does.

- **Constraint enforcement namespace filtering**:
  - fixed empty-namespace prefix filtering that caused unnamespaced edge IDs to be skipped during constraint enforcement scans.
  - fixed cross-namespace leak in transaction-level temporal constraint enforcement where pending edges from other namespaces could cause false violations.

- **Owned backing index metadata**:
  - fixed `SHOW INDEXES` to carry `entityType` and `owningConstraint` through relationship-scoped backing indexes instead of hardcoding NODE and nil.

- **macOS installer service lifecycle**:
  - fixed start/stop/restart controls to behave correctly for the macOS service.

- **Graph API hardening**:
  - hardened graph MVCC/diff handlers, aligned graph endpoint contracts, and improved validation and error mapping for the graph API.

### Security

- Updated dependencies to resolve vulnerability scan findings.
- Updated example code to pass security scanning.

### Tests

- Added and expanded regression coverage for:
  - all relationship constraint families (uniqueness, existence, property type, key) with DDL, creation-time validation, and write-path enforcement tests
  - relationship temporal no-overlap constraints (3-property and 4-property forms)
  - domain/enum constraints on nodes and relationships with conflict detection
  - `IF NOT EXISTS` idempotency semantics for all constraint types
  - embedding property namespace pollution removal
  - ORDER BY stability on returned node properties
  - CMEK/HSM encryption compliance
  - expanded unit test coverage across uncovered packages

## [v1.0.37] "The Walker" - 2026-04-01

### Added

- **Inline mutation-time embedding in Cypher (`WITH EMBEDDING`)**:
  - added support for `WITH EMBEDDING` on write statements so node mutations and managed embedding writes happen in the same transaction.
  - supports common mutation shapes including `CREATE`, `MERGE ... SET`, `MATCH ... SET`, and `UNWIND` write pipelines.

Example usage:

```cypher
CREATE (d:Doc {id: 'd1', content: 'hello world'})
WITH EMBEDDING
RETURN count(d) AS created
```

```cypher
UNWIND $rows AS row
MERGE (d:Doc {id: row.id})
SET d.content = row.content
WITH EMBEDDING
RETURN count(d) AS upserted
```

- **Shared embedding utility package**:
  - added `pkg/embeddingutil` to centralize canonical embedding text construction, metadata-key detection, invalidation, and managed embedding payload shaping.

### Changed

- **Cypher traversal and CALL-tail performance/coverage**:
  - generalized and hardened hot paths for benchmark-shaped `CALL ... YIELD` + traversal queries, `UNWIND` merge pipelines, and variable-length traversal aggregation patterns.
  - expanded E2E and benchmark coverage for real query shapes used in traversal/vector workloads.

- **Async and eventual consistency behavior**:
  - expanded async engine eventual-create eligibility and completed additional read-your-own-write (RYOW) coverage.
  - aligned async HTTP behavior and transport/docs guidance for consistency.

- **Documentation updates for user-facing query behavior**:
  - added/updated user docs for mutation-time embedding and vector search usage, including practical `WITH EMBEDDING` examples and caveats.

### Fixed

- **Cypher correctness across complex pipelines**:
  - fixed `WITH DISTINCT` projection behavior in pipeline routing.
  - fixed `CALL` argument parsing for tail function expressions.
  - fixed `YIELD ... WHERE elementId(...)` handling to preserve actual yielded entities.
  - fixed path aggregate semantics for variable-length `MATCH` and related traversal aggregate edge cases.

- **Storage/server stability under mixed write + background load**:
  - fixed scenarios where deleted nodes could reappear during index builds.
  - improved MVCC head rebuild batching and prioritized transaction hot paths over embedding worker pressure.
  - fixed auth-disabled mode write-gating behavior to avoid incorrect RBAC blocking when authentication is off.

### Tests

- Added and expanded regression coverage for:
  - `WITH EMBEDDING` mutation patterns (`CREATE`, multi-create, `MERGE/SET`, `MATCH/SET`, `UNWIND`, explicit transactions)
  - CALL-tail traversal fast paths and benchmark shape handling
  - async engine RYOW/eventual-create behavior and MVCC conflict-sensitive paths
  - embedding invalidation and shared utility behavior across Cypher/DB/worker paths

## [v1.0.36] "Gold on the Cieling" - 2026-03-30

### Added

- **Deterministic token-aware text chunking infrastructure**:
  - added `pkg/textchunk` as a reusable deterministic chunk splitter driven by caller-supplied token counters instead of heuristic token estimation.
  - added exact tokenizer-backed chunking support to the local GGUF/llama embedding path so local models can split oversized text using the real model vocabulary limits.

### Changed

- **Embedding and semantic-search query chunking architecture**:
  - widened embedding/query interfaces to require provider-owned `ChunkText(...)` behavior so Cypher, HTTP search, MCP, Heimdall, gRPC, and DB-level query embedding all route chunking through the active embedder instead of a shared heuristic utility.
  - added DB query-chunk helper paths for global and per-database embedders so query chunking stays aligned with the same model configuration used for query embeddings.

- **Documentation, publishing, and quick-start guidance**:
  - refreshed docs navigation, README and deployment/search/transaction guidance, and updated quick-start instructions to better match current runtime behavior.
  - enabled and aligned GitHub Pages publishing behavior and corrected documentation link/navigation issues discovered during the doc refresh.

- **Benchmarking and build maintenance**:
  - updated benchmark assets and related build assumptions used during performance comparison work.
  - refreshed release/build housekeeping associated with the current toolchain and packaging flow.

### Fixed

- **Tokenizer overflow handling for long embedding inputs**:
  - fixed long-query and long-document embedding paths to stop relying on approximate token counting, preventing deterministic tokenizer overflows and repeated retry loops for text that exceeded the true model token cap.
  - removed the old heuristic chunker entirely and migrated affected call sites and tests to deterministic chunking behavior.

- **Bolt hot-path logging overhead**:
  - removed unconditional success-path logging from the Bolt query hot path so normal successful `RUN` execution no longer pays avoidable logging overhead.
  - preserved error-path timing/log visibility with regression coverage for the default-silent success behavior.

- **Background worker write-back observability**:
  - added auditing information for background workers that persist changes back to storage so asynchronous maintenance/update flows are easier to inspect operationally.

### Tests

- Added and updated regression coverage for:
  - deterministic chunk splitting limits, overlap behavior, and embedder-owned chunking across Cypher, DB, MCP, Heimdall, server, gRPC, Bolt, and embed-cache test doubles
  - tokenizer-aware long-query and long-document embedding behavior, including dimension-mismatch and chunk-cap branch coverage
  - Bolt hot-path logging behavior so successful executions remain silent by default while failures still log

- **Commits in range**: 14 (non-merge)
- **Repository delta**: 71 files changed, +2,889 / -2,472 lines

## [v1.0.35] "Clean Up Before She Comes" - 2026-03-27

### Changed

- **llama.cpp roll-forward and runtime alignment**:
  - upgraded the vendored llama.cpp integration and shipped local llama artifacts to `b8547`.
  - synchronized version pins across build scripts, packaged libraries, and Docker builder images so local, CI, and container builds use the same llama baseline.

- **Container and CI dependency maintenance**:
  - rolled forward Docker build dependencies and CI image references used for CPU, CUDA, Vulkan, and Metal packaging.
  - updated the bundled Heimdall and BGE image variants so embeddings are enabled by default in the batteries-included deployment paths.

- **UI and build-tool dependency refresh**:
  - updated frontend/package dependencies and related build configuration used by the shipped UI bundle.
  - refreshed release/build assumptions tied to current toolchain behavior so maintenance packaging stays reproducible.

### Fixed

- **Bolt autocommit database executor reuse**:
  - fixed the Bolt multi-database autocommit path to reuse cached database-scoped executors instead of rebuilding a fresh Cypher executor on each `RUN`.
  - preserved auth-forwarded remote routing behavior by keeping auth-scoped database executor resolution uncached.

- **llama.cpp upgrade compatibility on macOS and Heimdall generation paths**:
  - fixed the local llama generation context initialization used by Heimdall after the llama.cpp upgrade, eliminating a macOS CGO crash during generation-model loading.
  - added generation-context normalization so native model initialization stays within safe runtime bounds after dependency roll-forwards.

- **llama build portability and packaging behavior**:
  - fixed `scripts/build-llama.sh` to remain compatible with macOS Bash 3.2.
  - updated the ARM64 Metal Heimdall image to prefer locally available models before falling back to network downloads, improving reproducibility in restricted build environments.

### Tests

- Added and updated regression coverage for:
  - Bolt database-scoped executor cache reuse for non-auth paths and cache bypass for auth-forwarded routing
  - llama generation context resolution and safe initialization behavior after the llama.cpp upgrade
  - Heimdall CGO generation-model loading on the upgraded llama runtime

## [v1.0.34] "Hello, Operator" - 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Operator MVCC lifecycle control plane**:
  - added a full admin-facing MVCC lifecycle manager with reader tracking, safe-floor computation, debt planning, fenced prune apply, pressure bands, emergency behavior, and runtime cadence changes.
  - added admin HTTP endpoints to inspect lifecycle state, pause or resume automatic work, trigger prune-now, change schedule intervals live, and inspect top debt keys.

- **End-to-end lifecycle admin UI**:
  - added a dedicated `MVCC Lifecycle` page under `Security` so operators can manage lifecycle behavior without direct API calls.
  - added confirmation-gated controls for pause, resume, prune-now, and schedule changes, plus views for pressure, debt, readers, per-namespace summaries, and short-window rollups.

- **Lifecycle architecture and operator documentation**:
  - added architecture documentation for MVCC lifecycle and background work behavior.
  - added a user guide for lifecycle API and UI workflows, including interval tuning guidance for mixed, churn-heavy, and manual-only operating modes.

### Changed

- **Storage engine lifecycle integration**:
  - propagated lifecycle support through Badger, async, WAL, namespaced, and multi-database wrappers so MVCC controls remain available across wrapped deployments.
  - wired database runtime startup to initialize lifecycle management from config and expose status through DB admin methods and Heimdall metrics.

- **Runtime lifecycle configurability**:
  - added config support for enabling lifecycle management, setting the cycle interval, bounding snapshot lifetime, capping pathological chain growth, and debouncing write-triggered embedding work.
  - lifecycle cadence can now be changed at runtime, including switching a database into manual-only mode with `0s`.

- **Operator visibility and protection signals**:
  - transaction responses now surface MVCC pressure warnings so clients can see when pinned history is building.
  - lifecycle metrics now expose pressure, debt, readers, rollups, and debt hotspots for easier diagnosis before maintenance pressure becomes an incident.

### Fixed

- **Pressure-driven snapshot handling**:
  - fixed explicit transaction/session behavior so MVCC snapshot expiration is surfaced consistently as a retryable transient lifecycle error instead of leaking inconsistent terminal behavior.
  - added audit logging for forced snapshot expiration so pressure-driven cancellations are visible in operator trails.

- **Background indexing and lifecycle coordination under write load**:
  - fixed mutation-triggered search indexing to debounce queued work instead of amplifying one background execution path per write burst.
  - fixed search-service build completion signaling to avoid duplicate-close races during concurrent build and shutdown paths.

- **MVCC churn retention behavior**:
  - fixed lifecycle prune behavior to stay bounded under repeated update/delete/recreate churn while preserving current visible heads and retained-floor semantics.

### Tests

- Added and expanded regression coverage for:
  - lifecycle manager planning, pressure hysteresis, fairness scheduling, emergency behavior, and metrics rollups
  - lifecycle delegation through storage wrappers and DB admin entry points
  - transaction admission, graceful snapshot cancellation, and hard-expiration behavior under MVCC pressure
  - server lifecycle handlers, pressure warnings, and audit logging for expired snapshots
  - search-service debounce behavior and idempotent build completion signaling
  - real-engine churn pruning bounds and tombstone compaction behavior

## [v1.0.33] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- **Live-data regression coverage for `MATCH ... LIMIT` hot paths**:
  - added integration/benchmark coverage for cache-busted simple read shapes (varying `LIMIT`) on real datasets.
  - added strict wrapper-delegation tests to ensure streaming and prefix-streaming capabilities are preserved across engine wrappers.

### Changed

- **Simple `MATCH ... RETURN ... LIMIT` routing**:
  - added/expanded dedicated fast-path handling for simple node-return limit queries and alias variants.
  - added explicit hot-path tracing hooks for these shapes to make routing behavior observable in tests.

- **Wrapper capability forwarding for performance-critical interfaces**:
  - propagated streaming interfaces through multi-database size-tracking wrappers so read paths can terminate early instead of materializing full scans.
  - propagated prefix-stream and label-ID lookup interfaces through WAL wrappers to preserve optimized behavior in wrapped deployments.

- **Label-constrained `LIMIT` execution strategy**:
  - changed label-only `LIMIT` collection to prefer label-ID iteration + targeted node fetch instead of full label materialization before applying `LIMIT`.
  - this improves latency stability for both sparse-label and dense-label reads.

- **Vector query concurrency behavior**:
  - reduced lock contention in vector query specification paths under high-concurrency workloads.

### Fixed

- **`MATCH (n) RETURN n LIMIT K` latency regression in multi-database stacks**:
  - fixed a routing/capability loss where wrappers could drop optimized streaming behavior, causing full-scan-like latency even with low `LIMIT`.
  - restored millisecond-range latency for cache-busted simple-limit query shapes after warm-up.

### Tests

- Added/updated regression coverage for:
  - simple `MATCH ... LIMIT` fast-path parsing/routing and trace visibility
  - label-limited node collection strategy (`label + LIMIT`)
  - namespaced/prefix streaming delegation through async, WAL, and size-tracking wrappers
  - real-data benchmark probes for cache-busted limit-shape latency.

## [v1.0.32] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **Cross-protocol access logging by default**:
  - added Bolt and gRPC request/access logging to match HTTP visibility behavior.
  - improves operational parity and troubleshooting across all exposed protocols.

- **Hot-path query cookbook (user-facing performance guide)**:
  - added a generic, domain-neutral cookbook of optimized graph query shapes and anti-pattern guidance.
  - includes practical patterns for key lookups, relationship traversals, review/queue-style scans, batched deletes, and pagination.

- **PROFILE diagnostics for index planning decisions**:
  - expanded explain/profile metadata to show index usage status and rejection risk reasons.
  - helps operators understand why a query used (or skipped) an index.

### Changed

- **Cypher planner/executor hot paths**:
  - direct ID seek planning for parameterized predicates (`id(...) = $x`, `elementId(...) = $x`) to avoid label scans.
  - improved OR/IN index planning (`a.p1 = $x OR a.p2 = $x`, `a.prop IN $keys`) with branch-based index usage and deduplication.
  - null-normalized predicate handling for better index visibility (coalesce-style boolean filters).
  - index-backed top-N execution for `ORDER BY ... LIMIT` when eligible, avoiding full materialization/sort.
  - traversal start-node pruning/index usage improved for relationship-match shapes.
  - streaming/batched `DETACH DELETE` execution improved for bounded-memory cleanup and large delete sets.

- **`/tx/commit` execution overhead reduction**:
  - optimized single-statement implicit transaction path to reduce per-request overhead in the common case.
  - tightened cache-key determinism for parameterized query shapes to improve plan/cache reuse.

- **Embedding queue scheduling behavior**:
  - introduced debounce/throttling behavior on write-triggered embedding queue work to reduce write-path contention during active traffic.
  - pending-index refresh scans now run with less interference against foreground writes.

- **Write-path lock contention reduction**:
  - narrowed lock scope in high-write code paths so longer operations perform less work while holding shared/global locks.

### Fixed

- **Neo4j-compatible conflict error semantics at API layer**:
  - transaction conflict/deadlock-style commit failures are now surfaced as Neo4j-compatible transient errors (retryable classification) instead of syntax errors.
  - aligns client retry behavior with expected Neo4j semantics.

### Tests

- Added/updated regression coverage for:
  - parameterized ID seek planning and index-backed IN/OR-IN query shapes.
  - migration-style exact query-shape execution paths and cleanup deletes.
  - transaction error mapping for transient conflict/deadlock responses.
  - delete-streaming and routing correctness.

## [v1.0.31] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- **Safe Unicode Cypher syntax normalization**:
  - expanded Cypher ingress normalization beyond Unicode arrows to safely normalize syntax confusables including dash variants, fullwidth structural punctuation, unusual whitespace, and selected zero-width separators
  - restricted normalization to query syntax only so string literals, comments, and backticked identifiers are preserved exactly as written
  - improved pasted-query compatibility for Neo4j-style Cypher copied from chat apps, documents, and rich-text sources.
- **Compound `MATCH ... OPTIONAL MATCH ... RETURN` result modifiers**:
  - fixed the specialized joined-row execution path to apply `ORDER BY`, `SKIP`, and `LIMIT` instead of returning storage/join order
  - restored deterministic aliased ordering for `OPTIONAL MATCH` retrieval queries and aligned the executor with Neo4j-compatible result semantics.

### Tests

- Added exact regression coverage for:
  - safe normalization of Unicode Cypher syntax confusables outside literals/comments/backticks
  - normalized `MERGE` and `OPTIONAL MATCH` execution through the public executor path
  - deterministic ordered results for mirrored-graph `OPTIONAL MATCH` retrieval queries
  - end-to-end parity for ASCII and Unicode-arrow mirrored `Section` hierarchy queries.

## [v1.0.30] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- **Unicode Arrow Parsing**:
  - fixed pasted Cypher relationship arrows using Unicode direction characters (`→` / `←`) by normalizing them to standard Cypher `->` / `<-` tokens before routing and parsing

## [v1.0.29] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Optimistic mutation metadata for async CREATE paths**:
  - added Cypher-side optimistic metadata tracking for created node/relationship IDs
  - async CREATE fast-path now records created IDs up-front for client response usage.

### Fixed

- **Cypher mutation and grouped-query compatibility for multi-entity update flows**:
  - fixed chained `MATCH ... WHERE ... MATCH ... SET ... RETURN` handling for update queries that join source/target entity sets
  - fixed multi-MATCH WHERE extraction to use the correct terminal WHERE before RETURN, preventing false `expected multiple MATCH clauses` errors
  - fixed `SET ... RETURN count(...)` aggregation semantics so update-count projections return deterministic values (`count(t)` now behaves correctly in mutation returns)
  - fixed chained MATCH normalization so queries containing `OPTIONAL MATCH` are not rewritten into incompatible required-MATCH forms
  - fixed joined-row aggregation handling for `COLLECT(...)` with non-aggregate return columns, preserving grouped-per-key result semantics
  - improved MATCH WHERE extraction boundaries in mixed clause pipelines so optional-tail clauses do not leak into WHERE parsing.
- **Correlated CALL/UNION correctness and performance**:
  - restored correct UNION subquery result behavior for correlated execution paths
  - reduced fixed overhead in correlated query routing/execution to improve hot-path latency.
- **Correlated CALL subquery write semantics (`WITH ... CREATE/MERGE/...`)**:
  - fixed correlated `CALL { WITH ... }` execution so imported node variables bind correctly across `CREATE`/`MERGE` write branches
  - fixed write-tail fallback rewriting to avoid dropping side effects for valid `MATCH ... CALL { WITH p MERGE ... }` shapes
  - fixed `WITH`-import boundary parsing so write clauses after `WITH` are preserved and executed.
- **Bolt parity for text-based vector queries**:
  - fixed Bolt database-scoped executor wiring so `db.index.vector.queryNodes(..., $text)` works when an embedder is configured
  - aligned Bolt behavior with HTTP/GraphQL execution paths for string query input.
- **Async transaction response metadata shape**:
  - surfaced optimistic metadata in transaction responses alongside receipt metadata when available.
- **Mutation stats and deduplication correctness**:
  - fixed DELETE/DETACH DELETE mutation stats under repeated OPTIONAL MATCH row expansion by deduplicating per-entity deletes
  - fixed branch regression where some SET/DELETE/CALL-IN-TRANSACTIONS paths returned nil projection values instead of expected results.
- **Mirrored graph retrieval compatibility**:
  - verified Neo4j-style mirrored `Section` save/query flows including `MERGE ... WITH ... MERGE` write shapes and `MATCH ... OPTIONAL MATCH ... RETURN n, r, p` retrieval.
- **Indexed OR-IN lookup path for key-list reads**:
  - added index-backed planning for predicates shaped like `propA IN $keys OR propB IN $keys` across alternate key fields
  - avoids full label scans for large key-list lookups and cleanup/read query patterns.

### Tests

- Added/updated regression and benchmark coverage for correlated UNION/call-subquery behavior and real-data execution profiles.
- Added regression coverage for:
  - Bolt DB-scoped executor embedder inheritance and string vector query execution
  - async CREATE fast-path optimistic ID metadata propagation.

  - CALL subquery write-path regression cases (`WITH ... CREATE`, `WITH ... MERGE`)
  - delete deduplication under OPTIONAL MATCH row multiplication
  - parser/import handling for `WITH ... WHERE ...` correlated subquery clauses
  - exact `UNWIND + OPTIONAL MATCH + collect(CASE...)` key-lookup shape (per-key grouped rows and null-arm behavior)
  - `DETACH DELETE` with `WHERE elementId(...)` + `OPTIONAL MATCH` cleanup shape
  - OR-combined indexed `IN` predicate planning without scan fallback
  - mirrored Neo4j `Section` import/query shapes including chained `MERGE ... WITH ... MERGE` writes and Unicode-arrow `OPTIONAL MATCH` retrieval
  - exact mutation query shapes:
    - `MATCH ... WHERE ... OR (...) CREATE ... CREATE ... RETURN ...`
    - `MATCH ... WHERE ... OR (...) MATCH ... SET ... RETURN ...`
    - `MATCH ... WHERE elementId(...) SET ... RETURN count(...) AS updated`
  - fan-out and null-arm guard tests for OR-based creation filters.

## [v1.0.28] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- **Vector query embedding cache for Cypher procedures**:
  - added executor-level embedding-result caching for `db.index.vector.queryNodes` / compatibility vector query paths when the query input is text
  - added in-flight de-duplication for concurrent identical embed requests so the same query text is embedded once and shared across waiters.
  - what this means: repeated semantic/vector query calls spend less time in embedding and create fewer duplicate embedding workloads under concurrent traffic.

### Changed

- **Correlated subquery execution optimizations**:
  - restored safe UNION fast paths in correlated `MATCH ... CALL { ... UNION ... } ...` execution with strict guards for write-safety and variable-dependency correctness
  - improved correlated seed extraction and batched lookup handling in subquery execution hot paths.
  - what this means: lower fixed-cost overhead for common correlated subquery/UNION shapes while preserving Neo4j-compatible semantics.
- **Query cache key normalization performance**:
  - replaced allocation-heavy whitespace normalization (`strings.Fields` join) with a single-pass compaction strategy.
  - what this means: fewer cache-key allocations and reduced GC pressure on read-heavy workloads.
- **Traversal optimization safety hardening**:
  - strengthened fallback start-node pruning behavior to fail open and preserve deterministic traversal semantics for chained/complex patterns.
  - what this means: traversal optimizations remain active without sacrificing correctness on multi-segment graph patterns.

### Fixed

- **UNION/subquery fixed-cost overhead in hot Cypher paths**:
  - reduced allocation-heavy row dedupe and subquery processing overhead for CALL/UNION shapes.
- **Correlated CALL + UNION semantics in mixed query shapes**:
  - fixed guarded fast-path routing to keep duplicate-row and chained-traversal result behavior consistent while optimized execution is enabled.

### Tests

- Added/expanded benchmark and regression coverage for:
  - correlated subquery + UNION fixed-cost cache-miss profiling
  - real-data Cypher/fabric-style e2e benchmark harnesses
  - traversal optional/WHERE pruning safety behavior
  - vector procedure caching behavior and compatibility paths.

### Added

- **Indexed temporal `AS OF` lookups and current-version tracking**:
  - added storage-backed temporal indexes keyed by namespace, label, temporal key, and validity window so point-in-time lookups no longer depend on full label scans
  - added current-pointer tracking for open/current temporal intervals and wired rebuild/prune maintenance through DB admin flows.
  - what this means: temporal queries scale with ordered index lookups instead of broad scans, and restore/startup flows can rebuild temporal state deterministically.
- **MVCC historical reads and retention controls**:
  - added committed node/edge version records, persisted MVCC head metadata, snapshot-visible reads, and wrapper delegation for namespaced, WAL, and async engines
  - added retention policy controls, pruning, retained-floor anchoring, and historical-read maintenance APIs.
  - what this means: NornicDB now supports explicit historical graph reads with predictable retention behavior instead of only current-state inspection.
- **Closure-based transaction helper API**:
  - added `DB.Begin`, `DB.Update`, and `DB.View` wrappers for closure-scoped transaction execution
  - exported `Transaction` as the public closure-facing transaction type.
  - what this means: callers can use transaction-scoped closures without manually juggling rollback/commit boilerplate.

### Changed

- **Storage transaction isolation model**:
  - transactions now anchor reads to a begin-time MVCC snapshot and keep point reads, label scans, and graph visibility checks pinned to that snapshot
  - commit-time validation now checks node, edge, endpoint, and adjacency races against the transaction snapshot.
  - what this means: storage transactions now provide standard Snapshot Isolation semantics rather than best-effort read-your-writes only behavior.
- **Cypher and MCP write-path stability**:
  - compound `MATCH ... CREATE` execution now reuses the standard single-clause MATCH binding path for safe query shapes, while preserving special post-filter handling for `NOT (a)-[:TYPE]->(b)` modifiers
  - MCP relationship/task mutations now retry bounded snapshot-conflict failures instead of surfacing transient storage conflicts directly.
  - what this means: common ID-targeted relationship creation queries are more reliable under load without regressing migration-style anti-relationship filters.
- **Temporal/search interaction**:
  - search indexing and rebuild flows now treat historical temporal versions as non-searchable and keep indexes current-only by default
  - temporal overlap validation now uses indexed predecessor/successor checks where supported.
  - what this means: historical state no longer pollutes current search results, and temporal writes avoid increasingly expensive validation scans.
- **Operations and configuration surface**:
  - added MVCC retention knobs to config, environment variables, and sample YAML
  - macOS installer defaults and first-run wizard presets now keep search reranking disabled unless the user explicitly chooses the advanced AI setup
  - clarified async-write consistency wording and documented retained-floor/MRS behavior.
  - what this means: operators have explicit controls and clearer expectations for history depth, pruning, and eventual-consistency modes.

### Fixed

- **Historical lookup performance cliffs**:
  - fixed sparse post-prune historical lookups by persisting a retained-floor anchor in MVCC head metadata.
- **Conflict normalization and retryability**:
  - fixed lower-level Badger conflict leakage by normalizing commit conflicts to `ErrConflict` with clearer concurrent-modification messages.
- **Compound MATCH...CREATE query-shape regressions**:
  - fixed comma-separated `MATCH (a), (b) WHERE elementId(...) ... CREATE ...` relationship creation so compound CREATE blocks reuse correct MATCH bindings
  - fixed the related regression where migration-style `AND NOT (o)-[:TRANSLATES_TO]->(t)` filters were bypassed by the single-clause fast path.
- **Graph-consistent concurrent delete behavior**:
  - fixed transaction validation so node deletes and adjacent edge changes cannot commit into a dangling-edge state across concurrent snapshots.
- **MVCC endpoint validation fallback behavior**:
  - fixed transaction edge creation/commit validation to accept readable endpoint nodes even when MVCC head metadata is temporarily missing, instead of incorrectly rejecting valid edges as dangling
  - fixed the associated transaction read fallback so missing-head recovery uses the transaction's anchored Badger snapshot rather than the live engine state, preserving Snapshot Isolation.
- **Startup/restore maintenance reliability**:
  - fixed temporal rebuild/search maintenance ordering and added explicit MVCC head rebuild/bootstrap flows for current stores.
- **Namespacing and shutdown hardening**:
  - fixed duplicate namespace prefixing in transaction and namespaced storage wrappers by making node/edge prefix helpers idempotent
  - fixed Badger `DB Closed` panics to return `ErrStorageClosed` and suppressed benign shutdown-time search indexing errors after database close/cancel.
- **HNSW runtime transition tombstone leakage**:
  - fixed HNSW result assembly to exclude tombstoned candidates that can survive in the search candidate heap after a delete during runtime strategy transition replay.
- **Plugin test isolation**:
  - fixed Heimdall plugin loader tests by resetting the global subsystem manager between test cases so plugin registrations do not leak across subtests.

### Tests

- Added/expanded regression and benchmark coverage for:
  - indexed temporal `AS OF` lookups, temporal overlap validation, rebuilds, and pruning
  - MVCC visibility, head rebuilds, pruning, retained-floor behavior, and search invariance smoke tests
  - snapshot isolation semantics including read-your-writes, repeatable label scans, write-write conflicts, edge/node delete races, snapshot-consistent edge traversal, write skew, and contention aborts
  - closure-based transaction retries and concurrent counter increments through `DB.Update()`
  - compound `MATCH ... CREATE` elementId relationship creation, migration `NOT` relationship filters, missing-MVCC-head edge creation fallback, snapshot-safe missing-head reads, shutdown hardening, namespaced prefix idempotence, plugin loader isolation, and deleted-entrypoint HNSW search filtering.

### Documentation

## [v1.0.25] - 2026-03-20

### Changed

- **Correlated subquery execution reliability**:
  - generalized correlated `CALL { ... }` execution handling for broader valid clause combinations, including mixed `WITH`, `UNION`, and procedure-yield pipelines
  - improved execution consistency for multi-stage query pipelines that combine procedural and graph pattern clauses.
- **ID-based query execution path optimization**:
  - added direct ID-seek planning for simple `MATCH ... WHERE id(...) = ...` and `elementId(...) = ...` query shapes
  - reduced unnecessary scan behavior for high-frequency point-lookup patterns.
- **Container build base-image sourcing**:
  - updated Docker build variants to use mirrored/public base-image registries for common runtime/build dependencies
  - reduced susceptibility to upstream rate-limit failures during CI/CD image resolution.
- **Keyword-aware clause parsing consistency**:
  - migrated remaining clause-routing keyword detection paths away from raw string index checks to shared keyword helpers
  - improved robustness for mixed whitespace/newline formatting and reduced false keyword matches inside expression bodies.

### Fixed

- **`WITH` identifier substitution robustness**:
  - fixed identifier replacement behavior to avoid accidental token corruption in downstream clauses.
- **Empty-seed correlated subquery result shape**:
  - fixed no-seed correlated `CALL` paths to preserve projected column schemas rather than returning fallback/internal columns.
- **Node import projection in correlated subqueries**:
  - fixed node-variable import binding so property projections from imported variables resolve correctly in subquery bodies.
- **Canonical ID comparison normalization**:
  - fixed `id(...)` / `elementId(...)` comparison handling by normalizing canonical element-ID inputs to internal IDs before evaluation.
- **MERGE resolution under stale lookup conditions**:
  - fixed merge-path behavior to recover correctly when fast lookup candidates are stale or conflict with already-existing rows.
- **Cypher compatibility hardening**:
  - fixed edge-case compatibility issues in optional pattern matching and UNWIND map-property access paths.
- **Nested UNWIND parsing correctness**:
  - fixed double-UNWIND `AS` parsing offsets so nested list expansion queries return expected rows under complex clause chains.
- **COLLECT subquery WHERE rewrite stability**:
  - fixed COLLECT-subquery rewriting when a `WHERE` clause is already present, preventing malformed query text and empty result regressions.

## [v1.0.24] - 2026-03-19

### Changed

  - removed brittle fixed-shape assumptions and aligned handling with broader valid clause combinations.
- **Server test fixture reuse**:
  - refactored high-frequency server test paths to share fixtures through grouped subtests where isolation was not required
  - reduced repeated full server/bootstrap setup in hot test paths.
- **Test startup behavior**:
  - disabled external embedding initialization in shared server test setup to avoid unnecessary async retry work in generic tests.

### Fixed

- **CALL clause boundary parsing**:
  - fixed `YIELD` parsing to respect CALL-clause boundaries instead of matching by raw string position
  - resolved cases where downstream clauses were incorrectly parsed or skipped in multi-clause statements.
- **N-column YIELD projection correctness**:
  - fixed projection behavior so `YIELD` supports variable-width output columns without shape-specific fallbacks
  - resolved incorrect/empty result sets in valid procedure-followed query pipelines.
- **Concurrent metadata snapshot race in multi-database management**:
