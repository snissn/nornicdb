description: Boost or dampen scores for NornicDB entities using promotion profiles and promotion policies — multipliers, ON ACCESS mutations, WHEN predicates, Kalman-smoothed behavioral signals. Use when writing CREATE/ALTER/DROP/SHOW PROMOTION PROFILE / POLICY in Cypher, configuring access counters, or shaping reinforcement / dampening behavior.

# Promotion Profiles & Policies (Cypher API)

Promotion is the optional second half of NornicDB's scoring pipeline. Decay handles time-based fade and runs entirely on its own (see `nornicdb-knowledge-policies` and `nornicdb-decay-tuning`). Promotion does two distinct things:

1. **Tracks access** — `ON ACCESS` mutations write to per-entity access metadata (counters, last-access timestamps, smoothed signals). This is the *only* mechanism that updates access metadata.
2. **Changes scores conditionally** — `WHEN <predicate> APPLY PROFILE '<name>'` causes a promotion profile's `multiplier`/`scoreFloor`/`scoreCap` to be applied to the decayed score when the predicate is true.

These two responsibilities are independent:

- A policy with `ON ACCESS` but no `WHEN` clauses **only tracks**. Scores are not promoted, but `LAST_ACCESSED` decay bindings on the same target can rely on the tracking.
- A policy with `WHEN` but no `ON ACCESS` **only promotes**. It evaluates predicates against existing properties / metadata at score time.
- A policy with both does both.

## Two objects

- **Promotion profile — `CREATE PROMOTION PROFILE <name> OPTIONS { ... }`**: a named, untargeted parameter set. Inert until referenced by a `WHEN ... APPLY PROFILE '<name>'` clause.
  ```cypher
  CREATE PROMOTION PROFILE <name> OPTIONS {
    multiplier: <float>,    -- < 1.0 dampens, > 1.0 boosts, 1.0 neutral
    scoreFloor: <float>,    -- promoted-score floor, applied before scoreCap
    scoreCap:   <float>,    -- promoted-score ceiling, applied after multiplier
    scope:      'NODE'      -- NODE | EDGE
  }
  ```
- **Promotion policy — `CREATE PROMOTION POLICY <name> FOR (...) APPLY { ON ACCESS { ... } WHEN ... APPLY PROFILE '...' }`**: targets entities with `FOR` and contains the access mutations and/or `WHEN` clauses. The `FOR` clause uses the same target shapes as decay bindings (label, multi-label, edge type, wildcard).

## How promotion enters the score

```
baseScore     = baseDecay(t)                                  // from the decay binding
promoted      = baseScore * multiplier                        // multiplier from the matched WHEN's profile
clampedPromo  = min(scoreCap, max(scoreFloor, promoted))      // promotion profile's floor/cap
finalScore    = max(decayBindingFloor, clampedPromo)          // decay binding's floor (independent)
suppressed    = finalScore < visibilityThreshold              // decay binding's threshold
```

Order:
1. Decay computes `baseScore` from the binding's parameters and the entity's anchor timestamp.
2. If a promotion policy targets this entity *and* a `WHEN` predicate matches, the predicate's profile contributes `multiplier`, `scoreFloor`, `scoreCap`. If no `WHEN` matches (or no policy targets the entity), `multiplier = 1.0` and the promotion floor/cap don't apply.
3. The decay binding's `scoreFloor` clamps the result.
4. The decay binding's `visibilityThreshold` is the suppression cutoff.

This is why `multiplier > 1` paired with `scoreCap < 1` is meaningful: the multiplier lifts the hot path, the cap stops it from dominating ranking.

## ON ACCESS mutations

```cypher
CREATE PROMOTION POLICY episode_reinforcement
FOR (n:MemoryEpisode)
APPLY {
  ON ACCESS {
    SET n.accessCount    = coalesce(n.accessCount, 0) + 1
    SET n.lastAccessedAt = timestamp()
    SET n.totalDuration  = coalesce(n.totalDuration, 0) + $duration
  }
  WHEN n.accessCount >= 3
    APPLY PROFILE 'reinforced_episode'
}
```

What ON ACCESS actually does, precisely:

- **Trigger:** every read or traversal of an entity that matches the policy's `FOR` clause fires the block. (A query that doesn't touch the entity does not.)
- **Target of the writes:** access metadata — a per-entity store keyed by entity ID, separate from `n.Properties`. Reading `n.accessCount` inside `SET` expressions reads from this same metadata store. The node's stored properties are never mutated by `ON ACCESS`.
- **Inspecting the writes:** `policy(n)` returns the access metadata; `nornicdb.knowledgepolicy.resolve(...)` includes effective values; a plain `MATCH (n) RETURN n` shows unchanged stored properties.
- **Timing:** mutations are buffered by an access flusher and committed in batches. Reads immediately following an access may not yet observe the new counter.
- **Read inside SET:** the right-hand side can read existing access metadata (`n.accessCount`, `n.lastAccessedAt`, ...), the entity's stored properties, and query parameters (`$x`) via the bind variable.
- **One mutation per `SET`.** Use multiple `SET` lines instead of comma-separated assignments.

What ON ACCESS does **not** do:

- It does not trigger or "tick" decay. Decay runs on every read regardless. ON ACCESS only updates the metadata that `LAST_ACCESSED`-anchored decay reads.
- It does not change `n.Properties`. The node payload is untouched.
- It does not return values. `SET` mutates; the policy block has no `RETURN`.

## Kalman-smoothed signals

Behavioral signals (clicks, dwell time, vote counts) are noisy and induce sycophantic feedback if applied raw. Wrap a SET with `WITH KALMAN { ... }` to smooth it:

```cypher
APPLY {
  ON ACCESS {
    SET n.accessCount = coalesce(n.accessCount, 0) + 1

    WITH KALMAN { q: 0.1, r: 88.0, varianceScale: 10.0, windowSize: 32 }
      SET n.relevance = $observation
  }
  WHEN n.relevance > 0.7
    APPLY PROFILE 'high_relevance'
}
```

Defaults applied when a key is omitted:
- `q = 0.1` — process noise (how fast the underlying value drifts)
- `r = 88.0` — measurement noise
- `varianceScale = 10.0` — auto-R sensitivity
- `windowSize = 32` — rolling window for variance estimation

Setting `r` explicitly switches the filter from auto-R mode to manual mode. Auto mode is recommended unless you have a known sensor model.

## WHEN predicates

`WHEN <expr> APPLY PROFILE '<name>'` runs after ON ACCESS mutations are flushed, so predicates can reference the freshly-updated access fields:

```cypher
WHEN n.accessCount >= 3                APPLY PROFILE 'reinforced'
WHEN n.lastAccessedAt > timestamp() - 3600000  APPLY PROFILE 'hot'
WHEN n.relevance > 0.7 AND n.tenantId = $tenant  APPLY PROFILE 'tenant_high'
```

Multiple `WHEN` clauses are evaluated in declaration order; the first matching profile wins.

## Targets

Promotion policies use the same `FOR` shapes as decay bindings:

```cypher
FOR (n:Label)                    -- single label
FOR (n:Label1:Label2)            -- all labels must match
FOR ()-[r:CO_ACCESSED]-()        -- edge type
FOR ()                           -- wildcard (catches everything else)
```

## Common patterns

### Reinforce after N accesses

```cypher
CREATE PROMOTION PROFILE reinforced OPTIONS { multiplier: 1.5, scoreFloor: 0.20, scoreCap: 0.95 }

CREATE PROMOTION POLICY reinforce_after_three
FOR (n:Memory)
APPLY {
  ON ACCESS { SET n.accessCount = coalesce(n.accessCount, 0) + 1 }
  WHEN n.accessCount >= 3 APPLY PROFILE 'reinforced'
}
```

### Dampen frequently-accessed (anti-sycophancy)

```cypher
CREATE PROMOTION PROFILE access_dampener OPTIONS { multiplier: 0.5, scoreFloor: 0.0, scoreCap: 1.0 }

CREATE PROMOTION POLICY hot_path_dampening
FOR (n:Memory)
APPLY {
  ON ACCESS {
    SET n.accessCount = coalesce(n.accessCount, 0) + 1
    SET n.lastAccessedAt = timestamp()
  }
  WHEN n.accessCount >= 5 APPLY PROFILE 'access_dampener'
}
```

Combined with an inverted decay profile (`halfLifeSeconds: -86400, scoreFrom: 'LAST_ACCESSED'`), this implements interference-driven forgetting: idle entries strengthen, frequently-accessed entries get pinned at half-strength.

### Recency-weighted edge boost

```cypher
CREATE PROMOTION PROFILE fresh_edge OPTIONS { multiplier: 2.0, scoreCap: 1.0, scope: 'EDGE' }

CREATE PROMOTION POLICY fresh_co_access
FOR ()-[r:CO_ACCESSED]-()
APPLY {
  ON ACCESS {
    SET r.traversalCount = coalesce(r.traversalCount, 0) + 1
    SET r.lastTraversedAt = timestamp()
  }
  WHEN r.lastTraversedAt > timestamp() - 86400000  -- last 24h
    APPLY PROFILE 'fresh_edge'
}
```

### Tenant-gated boost

```cypher
CREATE PROMOTION POLICY tenant_priority
FOR (n:Document)
APPLY {
  WHEN n.tenantId = $priorityTenant AND n.kind = 'high_value'
    APPLY PROFILE 'reinforced'
}
```

No ON ACCESS — pure score-time predicate.

## Diagnostics

```cypher
SHOW PROMOTION PROFILES
SHOW PROMOTION POLICIES

-- Combined catalog including profile vs policy rows
CALL nornicdb.knowledgepolicy.policies()

-- Effective resolution including which profile a WHEN matched
CALL nornicdb.knowledgepolicy.resolve('nornic:abc-123', '', '')

-- Inspect access metadata
MATCH (n:Memory {id: $id}) RETURN policy(n)
```

## Lifecycle

```cypher
ALTER PROMOTION PROFILE reinforced SET OPTIONS { multiplier: 1.75 }
ALTER PROMOTION POLICY reinforce_after_three DISABLE
ALTER PROMOTION POLICY reinforce_after_three ENABLE
DROP   PROMOTION POLICY IF EXISTS reinforce_after_three
DROP   PROMOTION PROFILE IF EXISTS reinforced
```

Drop the policy before the profile if both are going away — dropping a profile that policies still reference produces a validation error.

## Gotchas

- **`ON ACCESS` mutations are eventually-consistent.** Buffered in an access flusher and committed in batches. A read taken immediately after an access may not yet observe the new counter. Don't rely on it being synchronous.
- **A promotion policy is not required for decay to work.** Create promotion only to (a) update `lastAccessedAt` for `LAST_ACCESSED` decay, (b) track behavioral signals, or (c) conditionally apply a profile.
- **`ON ACCESS` writes go to access metadata, never to `n.Properties`.** Inspect with `policy(n)` or `nornicdb.knowledgepolicy.resolve(...)`.
- **`WITH KALMAN` only smooths a single SET expression.** Chain multiple Kalman blocks if you have multiple noisy fields.
- **`multiplier: 0.0`** collapses the promoted score to the promotion `scoreFloor`. To "disable" a profile, `ALTER` it (e.g. set `multiplier: 1.0`) or drop the policy that references it.
- **`scoreCap < scoreFloor` on a promotion profile** is a misconfiguration. Clamping order is floor-then-cap, so the cap wins and the floor becomes inert.
- **A `WHEN` predicate that references an undefined property** returns null and is treated as not matching. Use `coalesce(n.foo, 0)` to be explicit.
- **Multiple `WHEN` clauses are tried in declaration order; first match wins.** Order from most-specific to most-general.
- **`ALTER PROMOTION POLICY ... ENABLE / DISABLE`** is a runtime toggle. A disabled policy still appears in `SHOW PROMOTION POLICIES` but neither tracks access nor promotes scores.
