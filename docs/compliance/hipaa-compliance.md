# HIPAA Compliance

**How NornicDB's security features satisfy HIPAA requirements.**

Last Updated: April 2026

---

## Overview

NornicDB encrypts and protects all data in the database uniformly — not just specific fields or record types. This all-or-nothing approach simplifies HIPAA compliance because there is no need to identify, tag, or configure individual Protected Health Information (PHI) fields. Every node, edge, index, and metadata entry receives the same encryption, access control, and audit treatment.

This document maps NornicDB's built-in security features to the HIPAA Security Rule and provides a configuration guide for covered entities and business associates.

## Encryption at Rest

NornicDB uses **full database encryption** at the storage layer. When enabled, all data is encrypted — every node, edge, property, index entry, and internal metadata. There is no per-field configuration because everything is protected equally.

```yaml
database:
  encryption_enabled: true
  encryption_password: "your-secure-password-here"
```

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Scope**: All data, indexes, and metadata
- **No field-level configuration needed** — encryption is all-or-nothing
- **Important**: If you lose your encryption password, your data cannot be recovered. Store it securely using a secrets manager (e.g. HashiCorp Vault, GCP Secret Manager).

---

## Access Control (§164.312(a))

### Authentication

Every user has a unique identity. NornicDB supports JWT-based authentication with configurable session policies:

```yaml
auth:
  enabled: true
  session_timeout: 15m
  max_failed_attempts: 3
  lockout_duration: 30m
```

### Role-Based Access Control

Define roles that enforce minimum-necessary access. NornicDB ships built-in `admin`, `editor`, and `viewer` roles, plus a runtime API for creating custom roles, assigning per-database access, and tuning per-(role, database) read/write privileges. Roles are managed at runtime, not in YAML:

```bash
# Create a "clinician" role
curl -X POST http://localhost:7474/auth/roles \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "clinician"}'

# Restrict the role to a specific database
curl -X PUT http://localhost:7474/auth/access/databases \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role": "clinician", "databases": ["patient_records"]}'

# Grant read+write privileges within that database
curl -X PUT http://localhost:7474/auth/access/privileges \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"role": "clinician", "database": "patient_records", "read": true, "write": true}]'
```

See [RBAC](rbac.md) and [Per-Database RBAC](../security/per-database-rbac.md) for the full surface, including the entitlements list and lockout-recovery procedures.

### Minimum Necessary Access

Enforce minimum-necessary access at the query level by returning only required fields:

```cypher
MATCH (p:Patient {id: $id})
RETURN p.name, p.date_of_birth
```

Combined with per-database RBAC, this ensures users only reach data relevant to their role.

## Audit Controls (§164.312(b))

### Audit Events

NornicDB logs all security-relevant events:

| Event | Logged Data |
|---|---|
| Authentication | User, IP, timestamp, success/failure |
| Data Access | User, database, query, timestamp |
| Data Modification | User, database, operation, timestamp |
| Data Export | User, format, record count |
| Configuration Changes | User, setting, old/new value |
| Security Events | Event type, severity, details |

### Audit Log Format

```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_abc123",
  "timestamp": "2026-04-01T10:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "DATA_ACCESS",
  "user_id": "clinician-123",
  "user_name": "Dr. Smith",
  "database": "patient_records",
  "action": "READ",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "details": "MATCH (p:Patient) RETURN p LIMIT 10"
}
```

### Retention

HIPAA requires audit records to be retained for at least 6 years. Configure under `compliance:`:

```yaml
compliance:
  audit_enabled: true
  audit_log_path: "/var/log/nornicdb/audit.log"
  audit_retention_days: 2555  # 7 years (exceeds HIPAA 6-year minimum)
```

Hash-chained audit logs and integrity verification are properties of the audit subsystem itself (each entry includes a hash of the previous entry) and are not separately configurable.

---

## Transmission Security (§164.312(e))

### TLS Configuration

All connections should use TLS. Configure HTTP and Bolt listeners separately:

```yaml
server:
  tls:
    enabled: true
    cert_file: /etc/nornicdb/server.crt
    key_file: /etc/nornicdb/server.key
  bolt_tls_enabled: true
```

The minimum TLS version, preferred version, and cipher suites are not exposed through public YAML today; they default to standard library defaults (TLS 1.2 minimum, with strong-cipher selection).

### Certificate Setup

```bash
# Generate certificates (use your CA in production)
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 \
  -keyout server.key -out server.crt
```

In production, use certificates issued by your organization's certificate authority or a trusted public CA.

---

## Integrity Controls (§164.312(c))

NornicDB protects data integrity through:

- **Encryption authentication** — AES-256-GCM provides authenticated encryption, detecting any tampering with stored data
- **Hash-chained audit logs** — Each audit entry includes a hash of the previous entry, making it detectable if logs are modified or deleted
- **WAL integrity** — The write-ahead log uses checksums to detect corruption during recovery

---

## Breach Notification (§164.408)

### Detection

NornicDB does not expose declarative breach-detection thresholds (`alert_on_failures`, `alert_on_bulk_access`) through configuration. Instead, integrate the audit log JSONL stream with your existing SIEM or detection pipeline and define detection rules there. Audit events relevant to breach detection include `LOGIN_FAILED`, `ACCESS_DENIED`, `DATA_EXPORT`, and `SECURITY_ALERT` (see [Audit Logging](audit-logging.md)).

Review audit logs regularly and integrate alerts with your organization's incident response workflow.

### Response

Use the audit log JSONL file (default `/var/log/nornicdb/audit.log`) to investigate incidents:

```bash
# Filter all access during an incident window
jq -c 'select(.timestamp >= "2026-03-01" and .timestamp < "2026-03-15")' \
  /var/log/nornicdb/audit.log
```

## Business Associate Agreements

When deploying NornicDB:

1. **Self-Hosted** — You are the covered entity; NornicDB is software you operate
2. **Cloud-Hosted** — Ensure you have a BAA with your cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)
3. **Managed Service** — Require a BAA from the service provider
